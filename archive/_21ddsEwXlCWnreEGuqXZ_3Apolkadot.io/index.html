<div class='msg'><time>2024-04-17 20:32</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da6aa2'>syed</span>: If we want to decode shards/segment that  are smaller than 64bytes then we have problem with using SIMD I think. Because neighbouring bytes are not encoded in the same polynomial. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-04-17 20:33</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da6aa2'>syed</span>: so 64 bytes are encoded in 32 polynomials but each recover bytes with 32 bytes gap between them. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-04-17 20:34</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da6aa2'>syed</span>: obviously we can rearrange the bytes before encoding but that kill the whole purpose of the SIMD.</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-04-18 07:05</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: ok so this is the minimal size you can recover at a time? 4*1024
</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-04-18 08:34</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da6aa2'>syed</span>: You can recover 2*1024 but they are non-consecative bytes</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-04-18 08:35</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da6aa2'>syed</span>: So you can recover 1024 and throw out the other 1024</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-04-18 08:35</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da6aa2'>syed</span>: That way you recover one byte from each sharf</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-04-18 08:42</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da6aa2'>syed</span>: It is just that up to 32 consecutive bytes you have to recover double amount but you get the next consecutive bytes for free.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-04-18 10:38</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Ok. Hence the minimum sensible amount to recover is 4KB</div>

With the trie as specified this will result in long trie paths, with a bunch of branch nodes which have one half empty. Possibly could change the definition of M so that instead of always branching on b0 in the branch case you branch on the first bit such that l and r are non-empty?

<div class='msg'><time>2024-04-29 16:57</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c74b98'>alistair</span>: That doesn&#x27;t really solve the problem because if you can use brute force to find two hashes which agree on n bits then you can also with an extra 50% hash computations in expectation, find hashes with 1,2,3,..,n-1 bits of prefix agreeing with the first two hashes.  Now you still have a depth n trie. The only downside is that you now have to get n+1 hashes included instead of 2. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Afaik big endian aka network byte order is used in network protocols because it makes testing more robust:  If you omit an endianness conversion in only one place then protocol implementations typically fail in testing on little endian machines.  The bad situation this avoids is going into production with code that doesn&#x27;t work when ported to a big endian machine.  There is no reason to use network byte order if everyone uses some library that enforces a particular convention, like say protobuf, which likely covers our case more or less.  Also, you could skip network byte when you have a very tightly specified protocol, like djb&#x27;s crypto like ed25519 uses little endian, because he&#x27;s fighting much bigger implementor risks, while older crypto specifications like secp256k1 often used big endian, just because they didn&#x27;t understand implementation risks, so they addresses only minor ones. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-05-23 20:53</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#b9329c'>jeff</span>: I&#x27;d think the jam paper could just say &quot;byzantine assumptions, including 2/3rd honest, for the current and previous sessions&quot;.

It&#x27;ll be the (machine) elves paper that clarifies our assumptions, but maybe not something jam should discuss to precisely, due to some technicalities: 

We make &quot;synchronous&quot; byzantine assumptions for the current session and all previous sessions, which includes that less than 1/3 of validators were miss-behaving, including being off-line.  We uses the &quot;network synchrony&quot; assumption only narrowly, and make a serious effort (no shows) to mitigate its weakness, which makes it less bad than it sounds. 

Arguably, we only require these assumption for the current and immediately previous session, so long as all parachains are all somehow appropriately publicly monitored.  We should not discuss this however since we cannot define this monitoring, and we&#x27;ll do things like elections on parachains, which probably do not satisfy such a monitoring condition.  And non-turnstiled zk parachains are likely eventually too.  It&#x27;s not worth discussing this.

<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-11 20:49</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#2fbc2e'>purpletentacle</span>: While this is a minor point, I think it is aligned with the intention of maintaining the formal rigor intended in the graypaper.

I feel there is some inconsistency in terminology concerning &quot;integer&quot; versus &quot;natural numbers.&quot; Specifically, when adhering to Section 3.4 (numbers), I believe that the text in sections like 3.6 should use use natural instead of &quot;integer&quot; to be consistent with the corresponding math expressions ($\\N$, etc.). This happens in various other sections as well, where talking about natural numbers or positive integers (unsigned?) would be more appropriate than just &quot;integers&quot;

Generally, the mathematical expressions are accurate, but the narrative often uses &quot;integer&quot; in a broader sense. I think this is due to how the term is used in programming (unsigned integers, etc.) rather than math.

This inconsistency becomes particularly evident in Appendix C.1.2, where the encoding is defined solely for natural numbers, and there is no mention at all about how negative values should be handled. Also, I don&#x27;t seem to find any real need for serializing negative integers. Probably this section could be restricted to only encoding natural numbers and this shoud be enough.

If useful, I am glad to review and make a PR with suggestions addressing this along the text. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

5. Header
&quot;... Excepting the Genesis header, all block headers H have an associated parent header, whose hash is H\_p...&quot;

but expression (263) for header serialization does not indicate optionality (?H\_p). So should there be some exception or fixed value for the genesis case? For instance, like H\_p for H^0 is defined as some fixed preestablished value?

or instead, the serialization of H^0 is a special case that should be explicitely indicated in C.2 that H\_p should not be encoded for H^0? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

i was actually going to try and work on multiple implementations using multiple language sets (e.g. Rust, Swift Ruby, Python, TS) in parallel as a contingency incase i got stuck and couldn&#x27;t get support with one of them. after submission of our initial application form, will be possible for us to later on change what programming language(s) and language set that we&#x27;ll be using for the one implementation that could be eligible for the JAM prize? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-18 03:15</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#abc062'>mkalohood</span>: miss deleting.  The big endian and the little endian have two related concepts: 1. Host order: Different CPUs process data with different byte order types.  Intel X86 CPU is little endian, mips architecture CPU is big endian. 
2, network order, the network transmits data in the way of byte stream, and the byte order type in the transmission process is called network order. It is independent of the CPU/OS type of other specific devices, ensuring that it can be resolved correctly when transferred between different devices. it defines the byte order as the big endian. 

So basically the big endian is used before the network data is sent.

But , I don&#x27;t think the big endian is the deciding factor in VM selection. I think we can take it apart. The VM communication layer and data operation management can be separated.</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-23 13:40</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: For Appendix B.6 (General), B.7 (Accumulate) and Appendix B.8 (Refine) functions:

1. For ω parameter inputs, I did not understand why the number of parameters on the left hand side did not equal that of the right hand side:

- lookup \[h\_o, b\_0, b\_z\] = ω\_{1..4}  (3 vs 4) but then ω\_0 is used so ... ok
- read \[k\_o, k\_z, b\_o, b\_z\] = ω\_{1..5} (4 vs 5) but then w\_0 is used so .. ok
- write \[k\_o, k\_z, v\_o, v\_z\] = ω\_{0..4} (4 vs 5) but there is no w\_4 ... huh?
- new  \[o,l,g\_l, g\_h, m\_l, m\_h\] = ω\_{0..6} (6 vs 7) ... huh?
...
- machine \[p\_o, p\_z, i\] = ω\_{0..3} (3 vs 4) ... huh?
- peek \[n,a,b,l\] = ω\_{0..4} (4 vs 5) ... huh?
... and so on
Then you use ω\_0&#x27; as a return parameter which has nothing to do with the input ω\_0, huh.    ω isn&#x27;t really doing that much for you it seems except to group the inputs, maybe just describe the inputs and output?

2. At least a line or two describing the each function, specifically referencing these ω parameter inputs would help a lot!  Whereas PVM opcode semantics are quite common place and need little additional explication, these functions are the heart of JAM and the additional explication would increase speed of comprehension and reduce guesswork.
3. I believe most of the functions probably deserve at least a passing reference in the main body, or solid exposition around present (242), (246), (252).  We can guess import+export+historical\_lookup but nothing references what peek, poke, machine, assign, delegate, quit (?), ... do yet.
4. invoke = 13 is a copy of solicit and surely deserves a different name to the invoke = 20, like invoke\_accumulate vs invoke\_refine.
5. Not clear what&#x27;s going on with numbers:

- new&#x27;s bump function 42, 9
- designate&#x27;s 176
- invoke=20&#x27;s 13 and 60

6. Not clear why all these 64-bit parameters (g, a, m) have to be split into 2 32-bit and joined back together?
7. A diagram for the whole DA system would be worth a thousand words.  I imagine you have them in your JAM slides.
8. If you don&#x27;t want to add more exposition because you want hyper compactness  ok I get it but maybe using <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Macros" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Macros</a> will allow implementers to disambiguate notation by just reading latex (?!) -- especially for any overloaded notation (E, W, s, C, c, t, ...) that is used to reference more than one concept, implementers can go look at the LaTeX source, where the macros would be unambiguous.

but looking closely at the test vector code:
(a) decimal 121 is hexadecimal 0x79  (so w_7 are the high order 4 bits INPUT, while the <em>OUTPUT</em> w_9 is the low order 4 bits)  
(b) the byte following (a) is &quot;8&quot; which is the other INPUT 
Basically r_A+r_D are together in one byte with r_B following. 

In contrast, the GP in (227) has both  r_A+r_B put together in one byte and with a byte holding r_D following that byte.  

The fix, I believe, is to adjust (227) subscripts from 
_A, _B, _D

Hopefully is not purely because of my lack of knowledge. 

I am confused by how the Bandersnatch ring root function O is defined in 3.0 and/or Appendix G.
This is required to complete the update of the key root in safrole.

...
    \where z &amp;= \mathcal{O}([k_b \mid k \orderedin \gamma&#x27;_\mathbf{k}]) \\
...

The appendix defines:

O(⟦HB ⟧) ≡ PCS_commitment(⟦HB ⟧)

GP points to <a href="https://github.com/davxy/bandersnatch-vrfs-spec/blob/main/specification.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/davxy/bandersnatch-vrfs-spec/blob/main/specification.pdf</a> ( which seems to be work in progress, A few TODOs, etc.). The document briefly defines <code>prove</code> and <code>verify</code>. Proving requires a secret key.. so it could not be applicable to key root update. Verify does not seem to be aplicable either.

- I cannot link with confidence what is PCS_Commitment in Galassi&#x27;s document.
- It is allowed to use external code (FFI) for bandersnatch VRF.

Would it he possible to provide more information about this step in Safrole, expand a bit more the appendix about Bandersnatch VRF or provide some reference on how the test vectors used the reference crate that was used for this purpose?
</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-30 21:09</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c9419d'>davxy</span>: Indeed. I&#x27;m going to update the Bandernatch with some extra info about the procedure used to construct the verifier and how to use it. The real meat of ring proof spec should be delivered by a dedicated document BTW. But apparently this one has not been made public yet. I&#x27;ll try to push for some progress.
For the moment, I think the brst route is to use the reference impl and have a look at the ring proof tests in ark-ec-vrf:
- <a href="https://github.com/davxy/ark-ec-vrfs/blob/3b4b3591aba62d206408052f6ffd5d5aba6d60a5/src/suites/bandersnatch.rs#L206" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/davxy/ark-ec-vrfs/blob/3b4b3591aba62d206408052f6ffd5d5aba6d60a5/src/suites/bandersnatch.rs#L206</a>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-07-01 00:51</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: davxy: gav  Some freshman questions on Safrole:

1. For your Safrole test vectors (&quot;tiny&quot;), what are the values of
$jam\_entropy  (was BYTES( &quot;sassafras\_randomness&quot;))
$jam\_ticket\_seal  (was BYTES(&quot;sassafras\_ticket\_seal&quot;))
$jam\_fallback\_seal (was BYTES(&quot;sassafras\_fallback\_seal&quot;))
and what  term in the GP does &quot;entropy&quot; (documented with&quot;Per block entropy (originated from block entropy source VRF)&quot;) refer to from the test vector
<a href="https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/blob/master/safrole/publish-tickets-no-mark-6.json#L4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/blob/master/safrole/publish-tickets-no-mark-6.json#L4</a>
?
2. I see &quot;attempt&quot; and &quot;attempts\_number&quot; was renamed to &quot;entry index&quot; and &quot;N&quot; in GP, but what happened to the &quot;ticket threshold&quot; and &quot;redundancy\_factor&quot; - are those \[what I thought key\] concepts gone (in which case, how?) or to be documented still?
3. Since a high level goal of JAM Implementation is to get NON-Rust implementations for Safrole almost everyone will surely use FFI into your recommended crypto package.  Can you ( @davxy) provide a single working test case like say this one
<a href="https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/blob/master/safrole/publish-tickets-no-mark-6.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/blob/master/safrole/publish-tickets-no-mark-6.json</a>
(or the scale equivalent) to set up the ring verifier, get the ring vrf output, and get the entropy buffer updated?  With a single well-worked out test case in Rust handing the &quot;Bare VRF&quot; and &quot;Ring VRF&quot; (specifically making the specific flavors exceptionally clear to &quot;I&#x27;m not a cryptographer, I just use cryptography&quot; engineers), I&#x27;ll bet everyone can use that to set up their <code>extern &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;</code> type FFI and pass most of the cases in rapid order.  Is this possible?
4. For the &quot;tickets\_verifier\_key&quot; eg
<a href="https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/blob/master/safrole/publish-tickets-no-mark-6.json#L210" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/blob/master/safrole/publish-tickets-no-mark-6.json#L210</a>
they are 384 bytes and it is labeled as &quot;gamma\_z: The Bandersnatch ring root.&quot; in <code>safrole.asn</code>. However in GP it is documented as being element Y\_R in (47) but in I.1.2 it says it is 144 bytes.  Can you explain further what this discrepancy could be due to? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

1. For Safrole test vectors the only thing we use is $jam\_ticket\_seal.
In particular this is used for the ring-vrf input construction (context in the GP) to obtain the ticket score (aka ticket-id)  during the candidate ticket verification procedure.
The value of $jam\_ticket\_seal&quot; is constant and defined as &quot;jam\_ticket\_seal&quot; ASCII string.
This is a thing that applies in general for values starting with <code>$</code> (e.g. <code>$foo</code> in the GP =&gt; <code>&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;</code> ascii string).
(Thank you BTW as I&#x27;ve just spotted that I was using &quot;jam\_seal&quot; instead of &quot;jam\_ticket\_seal&quot;, I&#x27;ll add the fix to the upcoming vectors PR)
The other constant strings ($jam\_fallback\_seal and $jam\_entropy) are used for block verification and per-block entropy production (which is passed as input to Safrole).
NOTE: The actual value of per-block entropy used by the Safrole test vectors is not relevant to have been really produced using the signature in the header. Here we abstract away from the value&#x27;s origin, we don&#x27;t really care for the sake of the Safrole test vectors and Safrole STF. In the specific case I&#x27;ve used:

    - entropy\_0 = blake2b(\[42\_u8; 32\])\[..32\]
    - entropy\_i+1 = blake2b(entropy\_i)\[..32\]
2. If you take as a reference the Sassafras RFC then there some differences.
One of these is the attempts number and redundancy factor, which in the GP are in practice simplified to one single thing (attempts number).
Threshold is gone.
Even though reading Sassafras RFC can help (as it is a quite similar protocol), always take the GP as the source of truth for JAM.
3. Sure thing. I&#x27;ll post here as soon as it is ready.
4. This is a very interesting observation. Current implementation serializes 3 extra fields (part of the SNARK SRS).
Serialization of these fields may be important **in a general application**, but here these values are constant.
I will definitely get rid of these from serialized data (I&#x27;m on it). The final size will be 144 (i.e. the last 144 bytes of what you see right now) <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

&gt; This is a thing that applies in general for values starting with <code>$</code> (e.g. <code>$foo</code> in the GP =&gt; <code>&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;</code> ascii string).
&gt; (Thank you BTW as I&#x27;ve just spotted that I was using &quot;jam\_seal&quot; instead of &quot;jam\_ticket\_seal&quot;, I&#x27;ll add the fix to the upcoming vectors PR)
&gt; The other constant strings ($jam\_fallback\_seal and $jam\_entropy) are used for block verification and per-block entropy production (which is passed as input to Safrole).
&gt; NOTE: The actual value of per-block entropy used by the Safrole test vectors is not relevant to have been really produced using the signature in the header. Here we abstract away from the value&#x27;s origin, we don&#x27;t really care for the sake of the Safrole test vectors and Safrole STF. In the specific case I&#x27;ve used:
&gt; 
&gt;     - entropy\_0 = blake2b(\[42\_u8; 32\])\[..32\]
&gt;     - entropy\_i+1 = blake2b(entropy\_i)\[..32\]
&gt; 2. If you take as a reference the Sassafras RFC then there some differences.
&gt; One of these is the attempts number and redundancy factor, which in the GP are in practice simplified to one single thing (attempts number).
&gt; Threshold is gone.
&gt; Even though reading Sassafras RFC can help (as it is a quite similar protocol), always take the GP as the source of truth for JAM.
&gt; 3. Sure thing. I&#x27;ll post here as soon as it is ready.
&gt; 4. This is a very interesting observation. Current implementation serializes 3 extra fields (part of the SNARK SRS).
&gt; Serialization of these fields may be important **in a general application**, but here these values are constant.
&gt; I will definitely get rid of these from serialized data (I&#x27;m on it). The final size will be 144 (i.e. the last 144 bytes of what you see right now)

Thank you!  </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-07-01 16:41</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c9419d'>davxy</span>: Alright we&#x27;re getting there.

I&#x27;ve updated the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/pull/5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PR</a> with all the fixes we&#x27;ve discussed so far. Check the description for the changes.
(if you find / suspect something else please tell)

In order to reduce the ring keys commitment to 144 (as per GP) I had to patch an upstream dependency. So I&#x27;ll temporarily point ark-ec-vrfs to the patched <code>ring-proof</code> for the moment (not pushed yet, I&#x27;ll notify here when ready).

Juan Leni | zondax.ch Yeah. Unfortunately there was the blake2b thing that invalidated tickets data and some pseudo randomly constructed things that were depending on the hash previously used.

For tomorrow you&#x27;ll have a clear example of how to use ring vrf (maybe I&#x27;ll put it in the bandersnatch-specs repo) <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-07-02 19:43</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: Thank you, this simplifies &quot;which flavor&quot; questions a lot!  But how can we construct <code>_vrf_output</code> not from 
<pre><code class=''>let _vrf_output = &amp;output.hash()[..32];
</code></pre>
(which uses one of the randomly generated secrets
<pre><code class=''>let output = secret.output(input);
</code></pre>
) but instead from the extrinsic signature ALONE

(and the verifier key and/or the set of authorities that can submit tickets)

This expectation of  <code>vrf_signed_output(signature)</code> being possible was set by this line here
<a href="https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/blob/main/text/0026-sassafras-consensus.md?plain=1#L228C34-L228C62" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/blob/main/text/0026-sassafras-consensus.md?plain=1#L228C34-L228C62</a>

GP 0.2.2 (303)+(306)
I think we would like a &quot;fn ring_verify()&quot; [and &quot;fn ietf_verify()&quot;] that does NOT set up a prover with any secret generation at all.  Is this reasonable?</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-07-02 21:52</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c9419d'>davxy</span>: It is quite easy. The signature you see in the extrinsic is a ring signature.
You can deserialize it into the <code>RingSignature</code> struct you see in the example (the one who contain the output+ring proof).
Once deserialized you can:
- validate the proof constructing the Verifier as the example show
- use the struct&#x27;s output entry to actually generate the vrf output hash

Does this help? 
To be more concrete, I&#x27;ll add an example as you suggested <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-07-23 00:46</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: The key insight, we found, is from RFC 26 \[which we&#x27;re not supposed to read and get too confused by because Safrole != Sassafras, but is an excellent introduction nevertheless \] in these:

(a)

<pre><code class=''>ietf_vrf_output (Non anonymous VRF): vrf_output(secret, input) == vrf_signed_output(signature) 
</code></pre>

(b)

<pre><code class=''>ring_vrf_output (Anonymous VRF): vrf_signed_output(signature) == ring_vrf_signed_output(ring_signature);
</code></pre>

The (a) case has the block author reveal himself through the signature of (a) in block authoring, and you can consider that &quot;Non anonymous VRF&quot;

The (b) does NOT reveal the ticket submitter, you can consider that a &quot;Anonymous VRF&quot;, which is the beauty of RingVRFs, an important invention.

The key AHA I think for people is you will put (a)+(b) together with the same Bandersnatch key like so:

vrf\_output(secret, input) == vrf\_signed\_output(signature) == ring\_vrf\_signed\_output(ring\_signature)

and this basically maps onto this line here from davxy :

<a href="https://github.com/davxy/bandersnatch-vrfs-spec/blob/1ec75e9a3af3a2be7dbca5090171c01e29ac5854/example/src/main.rs#L268C33-L268C48" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/davxy/bandersnatch-vrfs-spec/blob/1ec75e9a3af3a2be7dbca5090171c01e29ac5854/example/src/main.rs#L268C33-L268C48</a>

Once you understand that, all the GP notation will fall into place for you I hope.  The ticket submitter uses (b) _anonymously_ and once its time to author blocks (assuming its the non-fallback case, and his ticket submission is among the lowest), he uses (a) _non-anonymously_.  The ticketid is the VRF output common to both (a)+(b). <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Is it reasonable to have a &quot;tiny&quot; setup (like 6 validators, single team with  _maybe_ another team, enabling Milestone 1 &quot;solo&quot; networking PoC, easy to simulate and then run QUIC for real), &quot;medium&quot; setup (like 16-32 validators, enabling Milestone 2 &quot;multi-team&quot; networking PoC with like 4-5 teams, possible to simulate and do for real for a single team though with some basic resources) WELL before the 1023 validator set up (which few teams will have resources for, not sure if its even possible to simulate?).  I am wondering if a &quot;lite Appendix H&quot; (not in GP, but suitable for Milestone 1+2) Erasure coding would be worth it to support tiny and medium cases for simplicity / speed of implementation in this tiny vs medium situation, and could have significant utility in the next 6-9 months?   <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

- tiny C=2 x 3 = 6 validators
- xsmall  C = 4 x 3 = 12 validators
- small C = 6 x 3 = 18 validators
- medium  C = 10 x 3 = 30 validators
- large C = 30 x 3 = 90 validators
- xlarge C = 50 x 3 =150 validators
- xxlarge C = 100 x 3 = 300 validators
- The Toaster C = 341 x 3 = 1023 validators
where we can just have different RS codes in various JAM configurations to match.  I believe we only need 3 configurations (one for the first 3 milestones), but I think the RS code of 342:1026 is &quot;impedance matched&quot; to C=341+1 so probably there are more perfect values of C than others for smaller C?

What&#x27;s the plan for in-browser light clients? Would be good to have something web socket based (or maybe even REST 🤪) since nothing more fancy can be initiated from the browser context afair.

I wonder why the rate of 342:1026 is used for erasure coding, as stated in the opening sentence of Appendix H, Erasure Coding: “The foundation of the data-availability and distribution system of Jam is a systematic Reed-Solomon erasure coding function in gf(16) of rate 342:1026, as defined by Lin, Chung, and Han 2014.”

In particular, the precondition for the efficient implementation of the Reed-Solomon encoding and erasure decoding algorithm mentioned in the above paper only applies for (n = 2^r, k)</div>

Some candidate typo fixes for Appendix B: \[for GP v0.2.3\]

1. For <code>info</code>, it has <code>b_o</code> instead of <code>o</code> on the 4th mutation 
2. For <code>designate</code>, does the 176 (144+32 I gather?) need to be 336 to match (51)-(55)?  If not, what is the content of the 176 bytes per validator?
3. For <code>peek</code>, it seems to need <code>l</code> instead of <code>i</code>  on 2nd and 3rd mutation lines
4. Similarly for <code>poke</code>, it seems to need <code>l</code> instead of <code>i</code> on 3rd and 4th mutation lines <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Test vectors will arrive when they’re ready and in the order that they’re ready. I’d caution you not to be pushy about it. Doing so will not aid their swift arrival. </div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-07-13 19:19</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#db4dca'>celadari</span>: Hello everyone,

I have some questions, I don&#x27;t know if I should post them here or on the Jam Chat channel but 🤷‍♂️ here we go :

### Appendix G:

1. **Signature Set and Key Generation:**
    - To confirm, is ( F\_{m,k} ) the set of signatures using the IETF VRF (as per Goldberg 2023) where keys are generated from the Bandersnatch curve?
2. **Size of Y:**
    - Why is ( Y ) of size 96 bytes? We perform <code>decode(x:32)</code> and <code>decode(x32:)</code>. Does this mean that the first 32 bytes are the public key and the rest is additional data?
3. **Merkle Root and Public Keys:**
    - To confirm, is ( O(\[H\_B\]) ) the Merkle root of the Merkle tree where the leaves are the authors&#x27; public keys?
4. **Use of RingVRF:**
    - To confirm, do we use the ring VRF from the Jeffrey 2023 paper, with the first ring VRF construction (part 4 of the paper) and with \( \text{Com}^*.\text{Commit}(\text{ring}) = O([H_B]) \)
5. **Size of Y (second instance):**
    - Why is ( Y ) of size 784 bytes? We perform <code>decode(x:32)</code> and <code>decode(x32:)</code> again. Does this mean that the first 32 bytes are the public key and the rest is additional data? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-07-13 19:20</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#db4dca'>celadari</span>: ### Appendix I.4.5:

1. **$jam_fallback_seal:**
   - For <code>$jam_fallback_seal</code>, do we create an output with the VRF Bandersnatch as mentioned in the questions above? If yes, what arguments, context, and additional data are required?

2. **$jam_ticket_seal:**
   - For <code>$jam_ticket_seal</code>, do we use the VRF RingVRF? If yes, what arguments, context, and additional data are required?

3. **$jam_entropy:**
   - For <code>$jam_entropy</code>, related to on-chain entropy generation, what does it mean, and how do we compute it?

### Equation (59):

1. **Understanding Components:**
   - What are \( i_y \), \( i_r \), \( H_a \), \( H \), and \( E_U(H) \)?

### Equation (60):

1. **Defining \( H_a \):**
   - Do we define \( H_a \) with the \( i \) from the equation &quot;let \( i = \gamma_s&#x27;[H_t]^{\circlearrow}&quot;?

2. **Understanding \( H \) and \( E_U(H) \):**
   - What is \( H \) and \( E_U(H) \)?

<div class='msg'><time>2024-07-18 08:31</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: Cheme&#x27;s erasure coding process (now ours, via FFI into the same Rust libs) is as follows:

Encoding:

- blob is split into 4096-byte segments
- each 4096-byte segment is erasure coded into 12-byte subshards shared among 1026 (342 x 3) validators, ie 12,312 bytes

Decoding:

- available 12-byte subshards in a 12,312 byte encoding (only 342 of which are needed for reconstruction) are used to reconstruct the 4096-byte segment
- each of the 4096-byte segments are put together to reconstruct the blob

GP wants 4104-byte segments (W\_C = 684 x W\_S = 6) instead of 4096.   This is a real discrepancy. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

- **Solution A: Change 342:1026 to powers of 2 (e.g., 256:1024).**  Instead of using the leopard package
<a href="https://github.com/catid/leopard/tree/master" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/catid/leopard/tree/master</a>
we use the original author&#x27;s package:

- **Solution B: Change Y\_2 in GP**
This could be Y\_64, or Y\_192 as implemented by Parity here:
<a href="https://github.com/paritytech/erasure-coding/blob/6c22e28a7402cfc75381e430483defe8189df486/src/subshard.rs#L317" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/paritytech/erasure-coding/blob/6c22e28a7402cfc75381e430483defe8189df486/src/subshard.rs#L317</a>
or any multiple of 64 as per the docs:
<a href="https://github.com/catid/leopard/blob/6e5725ebdf9da4370b0bcc4f70fa8eb66f4e6198/README.md?plain=1#L27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/catid/leopard/blob/6e5725ebdf9da4370b0bcc4f70fa8eb66f4e6198/README.md?plain=1#L27</a>
where n and k represent &quot;original data length&quot; and &quot;recovery data length&quot;.

Neither solution requires building new packages (good!) but both require some parameter changes to the GP. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

1. Use the original 256 GF points as the values of the evaluation points, and then reverse-generate a polynomial expression, which is defined by the authors.
2. Therefore, substituting the 0th to 255th elements into this polynomial will give us the original data we need.
3. Next, substitute the 256th to 1023th elements sequentially into the polynomial to obtain the redundancy data we need.

See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20basic%20types%20of%20Reed%E2%80%93Solomon%20codes%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20original%20view%20and%20BCH%20view%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20with%20BCH%20view%20being%20the%20most%20common%2C%20as%20BCH%20view%20decoders%20are%20faster%20and%20require%20less%20working%20storage%20than%20original%20view%20decoders." target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20basic%20types%20of%20Reed%E2%80%93Solomon%20codes%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20original%20view%20and%20BCH%20view%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20with%20BCH%20view%20being%20the%20most%20common%2C%20as%20BCH%20view%20decoders%20are%20faster%20and%20require%20less%20working%20storage%20than%20original%20view%20decoders.</a>

Different algorithms (or even just different implementations) of RS coding could lead to different encoding results. Therefore, if RS coding doesn&#x27;t align among each JAM implementation, the encoding results might not be compatible with each other and may not decode correctly.</div>

the notation seems to indicate that when the dictionary then the following steps should be taken:

- encode number of keys/valuepairs ( formula 275 )
- then for each key value pair
- concatenate the encoded key
- concatenate the encoded corresponding value

if my understanding is true, then lets think about a dict with different keytypes and value types each with variable length. There is no explicit mechanism in the formal specification that would allow an implementation to properly encode &amp; decode the key value pairs.

I would&#x27;ve expected to also see some kind of <code>E(k*) = E(|k|) concatenated with E(k)</code> . same for <code>d[k]</code> <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<a href="https://hackmd.io/@polkadot/jamsnp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://hackmd.io/@polkadot/jamsnp</a>
For speed, I&#x27;d like to suggest we start with JSON and end with scale or protobuf.  Not arguing for protobuf over scale here ... but even though  JSON is something engineers tend to snicker at,  it usually makes debugging life easier, between individuals and especially between teams, at the expense of a bunch of (I suggest, temporary) serialization/deserialization.  Or perhaps JAMSNP can support more than 1 wire format.

Are the details of JAMSNP appropriate to develop by implementers and then turned into a GP Appendix after we get a couple &quot;serious&quot; implementations in to code complete form, or do you (+JAM protocol engineers) own this problem?

If you don&#x27;t own this, should implementers put something together into a polkadot-fellows RFC and then GP compatible notation?

 <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-07-19 20:32</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: SCALE, to the degree it matters. Most items will have a standard binary representation anyway. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-07-21 20:07</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: Ok -- maybe C.2 should be expanded to cover all the SCALE encodings, not just for blocks but for JAMSNP stream objects?  Here are my notes:

- CE: Ticket submission - <code>Ticket</code> is an _element_ of ${\\bf E}\_T$ (Section 6.7 Equation 73) -- serialization of elements of  $\\mathbb{C}$ in C.2 (Equation 288)
- CE: Work Report publication - <code>Guaranteed Work Report</code> is an _element_ of ${\\bf E}\_G$ (Section 11.4 Equation 136) -- Serialization of $\\mathbb{W}$ is C.2 (Equation 286)
- CE: Assurance publication - <code>Assurance</code> is an _element_ of ${\\bf E}\_A$ (Section 11.2 Equation 123) -- need serialization in C.2 and a set definition in I.1.1.
- CE: Judgement publication - <code>Dispute</code> contains _components_ of ${\\bf E}\_D$ (Section 10.2 Equation 97) -- need serialization in C.2, though ${\\bf B}$ covers ${\\bf c}, {\\bf v}, {\\bf f}$ components.
- CE: Preimage publication - <code>Preimage</code> is an _element_ of ${\\bf E}\_P$ (Section 11.2 Equation 153) -- need serialization in C.2 and set definition in I.1.1.
- CE: Block publication - <code>Block</code> is  Section 4.1 Equation 13, serialization of ${\\bf B}$ is thorough in C.2 (Equations 280-282).
- CE: Work Package Submission and Sharing - <code>Work Package</code> is Section 14.3 Equation (174), serialization of elements of $\\mathbb{P}$ in C.2 (Equation 287).
- CE: Audit-announcement - <code>Announcement</code> - see Section 17.3 Equation 196.  Need serialization in C.2 and set definition in I.1.1.
- CE: AuditDA query <code>AuditDAQuery</code> &amp; response <code>AuditDAResponse</code> - need serialization in C.2 and  maybe set definitions in I.1.1.
- CE: ImportDA query <code>ImportDAQuery</code> &amp; response <code>ImportDAResponse</code> - need serialization in C.2 and maybe set definitions in I.1.1
- CE: Public ImportDA reconstruction <code>ImportDAReconstructionQuery</code> &amp; response <code>ImportDAReconstructionResponse</code> - need serialization in C.2 and maybe set definitions in I.1.1

Beyond the above encoding nitty gritty, it would be powerful to have JAMSNP, for each stream, have a short description of when the sender is typically expected to send and the expected behavior of the receiver when receiving each of the above.  You could leave it as an exercise for JAM implementers, but why?

Pedantic question: Why is V=1023, C=341 and not V=1026, C=342 where the latter  matches Appendix H&#x27;s 1026?

Do you have a recommendation on how implementers get started with a &quot;tiny&quot; C, V, W\_C, W\_S?

<div class='msg'><time>2024-07-22 12:36</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#db4dca'>celadari</span>: I have a question regarding the safrole algorithm. Since the author of the block &quot;gives away who he is,&quot; shouldn&#x27;t the header also include proof that they are entitled to the ticket? From my understanding, $$H\_s$$ is a Bandersnatch signature of $$E\_U(H)$$ with same context as ticket, but I don&#x27;t see how it is sufficient to prove ownership of the ticket.

Shouldn&#x27;t we also include opring, using the notation from the 2023 paper by Jeffrey Burdges, where opring contains a NARK.Proof(comring, pk, ring)
?

I also reviewed the code in the Bandersnatch VRFs spec example. I noticed that the code assumes the prover\_key\_index is the correct one by using the same variable <code>prover_key_index</code> for both signing and verification.

I feel there is something obvious that I am not seeing :) <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

IIUC: the header seal signature is the proof. It is a bandersnatch sig (not a bandersnatch ring sig).  
This sig can only be created by the holder of the key for the slot of that block - which was determined in advance by the ticket contest.  

So by issuing a standard bandersnatch signature, they give away that they control the respective authoring key.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-07-22 13:12</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#db4dca'>celadari</span>: I agree that it is a bandersnatch signature but the ticket itself is generated using a bandersnatch ring signature.

How do you &quot;relate&quot; the holder of the key with the ticket seal in $$\\gamma\_s$$ ?

$$i$$ is known ($$\\gamma\_s\[H\_t\]$$) - and so is the expected Y(H\_s) - so what prevents me from signing with my own key E\_U(H), sign [] with context $$X_E + Y(H_v)$$ as well (since I know expected Y(H\_s)) then pretend I am the owner of the ticket ? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-07-22 13:19</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cdc232'>oliver.tale-yazdi</span>: Not sure if i understand what you are asking, but if you just sign <code>Y(H_v)</code> with a different key, then it wont verify.  
<code>Y(H_v)</code> is passed into the signature verification function <code>vrf_verify</code> alongside with the public key. Only the author key can verify for that <code>Y(H_v)</code>.  
so you cannot just &quot;steal&quot; the ticket by copying the <code>Y(H_v)</code>.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-07-22 13:29</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#db4dca'>celadari</span>: What do you mean by &quot;sign Y(H_v)&quot; ? H_v and H_s are both headers provided by the one submitting the block.

The vrf value/ticket is known (looking at <code>$$\gamma_s$$</code>) that is we know what $$Y(H_s)$$ is supposed to be. So we know the context of $$H_v$$ signature. So I can sign [] with context X_E+Y(H_s) using my own key and sign E_U(H) with context X_T+eta_3+i_r (I can try i_r equals 0 or 1), I don&#x27;t see what is gonna fail here</div>

SO a ietfVRF Proof on an output made by ringVRF is still valid
SO even if the ticket in gamma_s was made using ringVRF, using the ietfVRF.Verify with H_s as signature, H_a as public key and E_U(H) as aux_data should produce the same output (since output is independant from aux_data)</div>

&gt; 
&gt; 1. For Safrole test vectors the only thing we use is $jam\_ticket\_seal.
&gt; In particular this is used for the ring-vrf input construction (context in the GP) to obtain the ticket score (aka ticket-id)  during the candidate ticket verification procedure.
&gt; The value of $jam\_ticket\_seal&quot; is constant and defined as &quot;jam\_ticket\_seal&quot; ASCII string.
&gt; This is a thing that applies in general for values starting with <code>$</code> (e.g. <code>$foo</code> in the GP =&gt; <code>&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;</code> ascii string).
&gt; (Thank you BTW as I&#x27;ve just spotted that I was using &quot;jam\_seal&quot; instead of &quot;jam\_ticket\_seal&quot;, I&#x27;ll add the fix to the upcoming vectors PR)
&gt; The other constant strings ($jam\_fallback\_seal and $jam\_entropy) are used for block verification and per-block entropy production (which is passed as input to Safrole).
&gt; NOTE: The actual value of per-block entropy used by the Safrole test vectors is not relevant to have been really produced using the signature in the header. Here we abstract away from the value&#x27;s origin, we don&#x27;t really care for the sake of the Safrole test vectors and Safrole STF. In the specific case I&#x27;ve used:
&gt; 
&gt;     - entropy\_0 = blake2b(\[42\_u8; 32\])\[..32\]
&gt;     - entropy\_i+1 = blake2b(entropy\_i)\[..32\]
&gt; 2. If you take as a reference the Sassafras RFC then there some differences.
&gt; One of these is the attempts number and redundancy factor, which in the GP are in practice simplified to one single thing (attempts number).
&gt; Threshold is gone.
&gt; Even though reading Sassafras RFC can help (as it is a quite similar protocol), always take the GP as the source of truth for JAM.
&gt; 3. Sure thing. I&#x27;ll post here as soon as it is ready.
&gt; 4. This is a very interesting observation. Current implementation serializes 3 extra fields (part of the SNARK SRS).
&gt; Serialization of these fields may be important **in a general application**, but here these values are constant.
&gt; I will definitely get rid of these from serialized data (I&#x27;m on it). The final size will be 144 (i.e. the last 144 bytes of what you see right now)

Hi Davide,

I&#x27;m quoting this old message as it is related to my doubt. I have checked messages on the chat here and there and I just wanted to confirm my understanding of the test vectors regarding safrole.

- Just to confirm, in the test vectors &quot;input.entropy&quot; refers here to Y(H_v) of the GP, right?
- Thus, in the test vectors we don&#x27;t verify equations (59) and (60) (parts related to ark-ec-vrfs that I asked you about last week), right?</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-07-29 17:42</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c9419d'>davxy</span>: - As that old message reports, the <code>input.entropy</code> **for the vest vectors** is generated in some &quot;arbitrary&quot; manner (the quoted message reports how I generated it). In a real scenario YES, it is generated as per equation (66) of the last GP release (DRAFT 0.3.1 Jul 17). In the context of the safrole test vectors,  is not really important how we generate it as <code>H_v</code> is not present at all.
- In safrole test vectors **we don&#x27;t verify** the validity of the signatures contained within the header (i.e. H\_v and H\_s) simply because are not part of the safrole&#x27;s specific STF. These will be probably verified in some upcoming test vectors to asses block&#x27;s header validity <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-08-02 12:56</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#5c84c9'>prematurata</span>: i am still trying to wrap my head around that. so i can&#x27;t really find a practical  <code>l_x</code> for which <code>E_lx</code> is not computable. (not considering the case where the arguments input size is zero or formally <code>ζı+1 ∈ ϖ</code>).

I understand the reasoning about <code>condition</code> vs <code>computable</code> but, feel free to correct me. Since the <code>E^-1</code> is the inverse of <code>E</code> for which  there is no input for which <code>E</code> fails to produce output... then I&#x27;d expect (always mathematically speaking) that if the inverse function is &quot;called&quot; with a member of the output set of <code>E</code>which is **Y**l (aka a sequence of <code>l</code>octects) then, unless otherwise specified, there would be no reason to believe the inverse fails for some inputs.

<div class='msg'><time>2024-08-06 09:21</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#48d03d'>tomusdrw</span>: Hey there! The last couple of days I&#x27;ve been working on a tool that would help to read and annotate the Gray Paper. Looking for some feedback:
<a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/</a>

On the top of the priority list to implement is to display the notes within the document and migrate them between versions. I found myself having a lot of notes on a printed version, but they are hard to maintain when the document keeps changing, hence the website.

Another important feature for me is the ability to share a link to a selection - I&#x27;ve noticed here that many people share screenshots (which I believe is still good), but if the screenshots were augmented with such a link it&#x27;s easier for others to find the context of the  discussion (and the graypaper version the quote is coming from).

Curious to hear what would be important for you or what you&#x27;d like to see improved. The (pretty hacky) code is on github, so feel free to file an issue or a PR there.</div>

I tried a few things to have links to a specific formular but this is top. Does it search for the text or how does it resolve a link to a spot in the paper?

As mentioned earlier it&#x27;s pretty hacky :D The PDF is converted to HTML and it has a very specific structure. The link saves the HTML nodes that are selected and then searches for these exact nodes  when loaded. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to best &quot;migrate&quot; the selection from one version to another, but I&#x27;m positive I&#x27;ll figure something out, given I have full information about the selection (including page, section, subsection, gp version and the text content)</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-06 09:57</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#48d03d'>tomusdrw</span>: The migration to newer version will most likely need some fuzzy searching if the exact text is not found, but at least we can limit that to some particular section.</div>

i think there is a mistake in recent history -  equation 83
**the subscript s is supposed to be subscript x**

since _s_ is an availability specification, that does no have a _p_ sub-component (eq 122)
_x_, however is refinement context , that does have _p_ component that is a hash (eq 121)


or maybe it refers to <em>S</em> subscript *h*? the work package hash? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

My current read of the GP is that it&#x27;s fine to have programs with invalid instructions, since they obviously might never be reached in code and we still need to panic only if that particular instruction is reached during execution. And obviously that&#x27;s payed for.
However I&#x27;m thinking if it would be &quot;less wasteful&quot; to disallow programs with invalid instructions to be executed at all. But perhaps it&#x27;s over complication or not practical for some reasons yet unknown for me? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

We also have well-defined trap instruction to terminate the program, so no need for that to panic (like there was in EVM afair).
&gt; 
&gt; The only reasons I could think of is:
&gt; 1. Avoid the need of pre-validation completely (i.e. don&#x27;t assume there is anything like that in GP)
&gt; 2. Support some future extensions?
&gt; 
&gt; Is there anything I&#x27;m missing here? Perhaps the compilers generate a code with invalid instructions in case of panic?

(There are actually a number of exit conditions, an illegal instruction is only one of them and I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to happen in production.)</div>

No. When you see \se_4, use \se_4. The variable-length encoding functions are not presently used. They might be used in the future but for now you obviously don’t need to implement them to build a conformant implementation. </div>

We are using koute&#x27;s assembler to build  refine and accumulate toy cases (to do squaring [refine] and summing [accumulating]) to cover host function implementations by hand replacing &quot;17=0x11&quot; (fallthrough) with &quot;temporary opcodes&quot; in the 128 range since all host functions are instructions with no args (ie for historical_lookup, 141=0x8D).    

We can fork koute/polkavm and add our own little mapping for the 2 dozen host functions around here

That is, it is defined simply as &quot;seconds passed since the beginning of the JAM Common Era&quot;. Practically speaking most systems are UTC-based. The difference is that UTC is adjusted by leap seconds, whereas TAI is not. Sticking with the current definition seems good, as it&#x27;s conceptually simple. It&#x27;s probably worth explicitly talking about this in the GP though, as just doing the natural thing (current UNIX timestamp minus epoch timestamp) will on most systems not be correct. Well, it might be, if there are no more leap seconds. AIUI they will be abolished by 2035 but there may be some before then. I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a &quot;standard&quot; way of dealing with this.

Are you taking the lead on the next JAMNP writeup?

We are wondering if there really  is no gossiping of Tickets, Blocks, etc. within JAMNP as it seems pretty wild for each validator to broadcast to all V-1 fellow validators.  Not only that, if each ticket is sent to V-1 validators, all the cool anonymity will be canceled by QUIC.  Is there some detail of how QUIC will be used for gossiping objects quickly in JAMNP?

<div class='msg'><time>2024-08-23 22:56</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: gav: Some basic questions on Assurances.

1. From (185)+(186) _Availability Specifier_ $s$ (with h, l, u, e) ALONE (included in a Work Report), will an assurer/validator be able to reconstruct the _auditable_ work package (by querying fellow validators) after getting their chunk and a proof of inclusion using $s$ ALONE?  If not, what else does a \[non-guarantor\] assurer need other than $s$ from a <code>Guarantee</code> to reconstruct the _auditable_ work package (by querying fellow validators)?
2. If the answer to (1) is &quot;YES, s alone is sufficient for work package reconstruction (by querying fellow validators)&quot;, we need a _test case_ of a work package ${\\bf p}$ and some pretend exported items with this &quot;Availability Specifier&quot; $s$ computed (which is equivalent to a Auditable Work package and sufficient for assuring, if we understand correctly).  When can we get a ${\\bf p}, {\bf e}, s$ test case?  Having this will be essential for JAM implementers to have proper $E\_G$ verifiable work report generation and to get through a full $E\_A$ Assurance generation.
3. Given the proof referenced in Section 16 &quot;... Firstly, their erasure-coded chunk for this report. The validity of this chunk can be trivially proven through the work-report’s work-package erasure-root and a Merkle proof of inclusion in the correct location.  The proof should be included from the guarantor.&quot;  ... which QUIC message covers this proof _submission_ by guarantors to all other validators in JAMNP?
4. In section 16 &quot;Availability Assurance&quot;, you refer to &quot;provided&quot; and &quot;required&quot; manifests, seemingly for the first time, which appear to be &quot;inside&quot; the availability specifier $s$.  Are these ${\\bf b}^\\club$ (package, imported items, extrinsics related) and ${\\bf s}^\\club$  (exported items)-- which one is &quot;provided&quot; and which one is &quot;required&quot;?     (The 14.3 paragraph &quot;Guarantors are required to erasure-code and distribute two data sets:... &quot; which is similar enough to cause us to believe section 16 could be folded into 14.3?) <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

For the few blocks where a service is undergoing an upgrade then you’d probably want to avoid sending reports to it since it’s fundamentally impossible to predict which code is current come Accumulation. </div>

1. Why is the authorizer not a 4th entry point alongside refine/accumulate/on\_transfer?
2. In (182) you use blob-hood of ${\\bf o}$ (being an element of Y) to determine if work is authorized, but how does the PVM code actually return and &quot;set&quot; ${\\bf o}$ -- not clear from (248) how Is-Authorized can return a blob, e.g. a public key or recovered address.  Is it through \omega_10 + \omega_11 pointing to where the blob is returned in memory?   If so what is the &quot;not authorized&quot; return mechanism?
3. In 8.2 GP lecture you mention validating signatures, e.g. validating ${\\bf j}$ right at the start of the work package.   Shall we add ECRECOVER/... signature verification host functions for this purpose?
4. Why did you not support access to <code>historical_lookup</code> in Is-Authorized, to get at service-specific state?
5. It seems clear we will want &quot;opinionated&quot; inclusion of cryptographic primitives in ecalli host functions (BLS, Keccak/Blake2b/xx hash functions, Bandersnatch, Edwards, etc) due to the usual &quot;interpreted code is Nx slower than compiled, we must have this primitive!&quot; concerns.

<div class='msg'><time>2024-08-28 23:52</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: General JAM Service Invocation/Interaction-related questions:

1. How are the <code>refine</code>, <code>accumulate</code> and <code>on_transfer</code> entry points (described after (90)) specified in the jump table ${\\bf j}$ of Eq (213)?  We are currently just using <code>pub @refine:</code>, <code>pub @accumulate:</code> and <code>pub @on_transfer</code> in koute&#x27;s assembler, but this appears underspecified in GP except for some 0/1/2 entry points 
2. Given that <code>refine</code> can ONLY access on-chain state from <code>historical_lookup</code> host function calls (through <code>accumulate</code>&#x27;s <code>solicit</code> host function calls that result in $a\_p$ preimage writes through $E\_P$ extrinsics) ... I am struggling to see how <code>accumulate</code> can drive <code>refine</code> inputs -- _except_ via some observer who &quot;sees&quot; the finalized post-accumulate state and submits a new work package based on that state in the form of extrinsics and payloads.     Why can&#x27;t <code>accumulate</code> also have access to the <code>export</code> host function such that <code>refine</code> can <code>import</code> segments exported by <code>accumulate</code>?
3. Why can&#x27;t <code>refine</code> have access to <code>read</code> host function to get at state written to by <code>accumulate</code>&#x27;s <code>write</code> host function calls?  I imagine it would be <code>historical_read</code>, analogous to <code>historical_lookup</code>.
4. How can there be a <code>refine</code>-less Work Package / Service, _not_ needing Assurances to trigger an <code>accumulate</code>, that is purely <code>accumulate</code> based?
5. What is the _idiomatic_ way (via a specific instruction) to &quot;panic&quot; for authorization code to return &quot;Not Authorized&quot;?  We are doing <code>ecalli 42</code> as a hack right now on failed authorizations.
6. For multiple services going through <code>accumulate</code> what is the ordering of ${\\bf S}$ in 157?  Assuming serial execution (which is sort of implied by <code>new</code> \[building up ${\\bf x}_n$\] and <code>transfer</code> \[building up ${\\bf x}_{\\bf s}$\]), is the context ${\\bf x}$ (of Eq 253) carried over from one services <code>accumulate</code> to the next?
7. From <code>upgrade</code> It appears to us that the invocation context ${\\bf x}$ in ${\\bf X}$ needs its ${\\bf s}$ to be a dictionary like ${\\bf x}\_{\\bf n}$, but right now its just ${\\bf s}$ of ${\\cal A}?$.
8. Host function service account lookup ${\\bf d}$  needs an explanation before B.5 On-transfer.  It is used in <code>lookup</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>info</code> but we&#x27;re not sure whether its in ${\\bf x}$ and how its initialized.
9. Why did you keep machine/invoke/peek/poke/expunge solely for <code>refine</code> and not also <code>accumulate</code>?
10. $\\bar{x}$, the full extrinsic data (not hash-len combo) given to the guarantors alongside the work package, needs to be put into Audit DA, since re-execution of <code>refine</code> by auditors require it.  This step is not described, but is of course necessary, correct? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Getting any state-changes resulting from Accumulation as inputs to a later Refine would imply making a state proof, which introduces synchroneity and as such a degree of latency.

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-09-10 09:07</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: You already have service users submitting a refinement context within the work package, which includes an anchor block&#x27;s state root but not an unfinalized accumulate state root.  With Safrole, assuming very high liveness, you also won mostly forkless state roots.

So my lazy dumb strawman is that you can win <code>historical_read</code> parallel to <code>historical_lookup</code> in <code>refine</code> by modifying the &quot;anchor block&quot; centric refinement context included in work packages to be have state roots not
(a) relative to an anchor block
but instead
(b) whatever the work package submitter has observed to be a recent \[potentially unfinalized\] state root
The user already have to submit their work packages relative to (a), so what is lost with (b)?

I am not making a request for product dreams here 😅, I am asking why an observed unfinalized state root from the user is an insufficient state proof.

If 2 or 3 Guarantors refine a work package according to some unfinalized state root but it doesn&#x27;t get finalized, then the work report doesn&#x27;t get assured, it doesn&#x27;t get audited, and so it just times out.

The claim is that if this timeout is quite rare in practice, the experience for users improves tremendously with <code>historical_read</code> and a streamlined &quot;accumulate=&gt;refine&quot; .

The lazy/dumb GP modification would be extend what what you have in 9.2 &quot;By retaining historical information on its availability,
we become confident that any validator with a recently finalized view of the chain is able to determine whether any
given preimage was available at any time within the period
where auditing may occur.&quot; from preimages alone to what is done with <code>write</code> operations.  Still asynchronous post-write here, but with less latency than (a).

The new requirement is that any services aggressive work results (with aggressive (b)) would only be able to affect <code>accumulate</code> if the refinement context&#x27;s state root in conception (b) was finalized.   

I understand this is in the &quot;better to implement JAM to safely crawl before JAM walks/runs&quot; region here.  But you claim running with (b)&#x27;s aggressive refinement context is unachievable because ... what? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Elves requires that all validators are able to audit all Work Reports *regardless of whether they’re synced to the same fork or not*. All host functions available to Refine must return exactly the same result for any node on any fork beyond the lookup-anchor. Since we cannot assume any particular state is known (even the lookup anchor block’s state, which could be very old and is likely pruned) then our host functions must be pretty much stateless. Historical lookup works only because we know, at any block up to 24 hours later, whether a preimage was known at the time and if so what it was. We manage this only with specialised data structures (in accounts) and limiting the rate at which a preimage may be supplied, removed and supplied again to avoid state blowup. This can all be discovered by a thorough read of the GP. The design would not cleanly apply to more arbitrary and general state changes such as service storage.  <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

In the case that there is a negative judgement, it is thus expected that all validators will produce a judgement. If a block author has seen enough judgements to build a verdict then they will do this.</div>

1. A generic program without memory segmentation. In this case we start from empty memory and we can call <code>sbrk</code> until the memory exceed 2 ** 32. what should happen then? 
2. A &quot;standard program initialization&quot; program. In this case we have heap between 2Z_Q + Q(|o|)  and 2**32 - 2Z_Q - Z_I - P(s) (beginning of stack segment). what should happen when the memory that we allocated exceeds the heap segment?

I guess in both cases it should be a page fault but what should be the address then? we don&#x27;t pass any address to <code>sbrk</code> so there is no any strict point where this fault could happen</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-09-05 17:38</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: Memory allocation/deallocation handling is still a work-in-progress, and it&#x27;s possible the <code>sbrk</code> instruction will get modified and/or removed. I&#x27;d suggest you temporarily skip it and focus on other parts of JAM and/or PVM.

---

If you&#x27;re interested in some history as to why <code>sbrk</code> is there then let me give you some background.

Historically I designed PolkaVM (on which PVM in the GP is based on) to be a VM which is as &quot;powerful&quot; as WASM VMs (so it can completely replace our current WASM-based executor in Polkadot 1.0 and our WASM-based smart contracts VM) while being as simple as possible to implement, and without sacrificing any performance.
So this is where the idea for the <code>sbrk</code> came from (which is similar to what WASM has): the VM maintains a heap pointer, and the guest program can use <code>sbrk</code> to query that pointer and/or to bump it up. And every time it crosses a page boundary the VM allocates new memory for the program.

So this design has numerous benefits. First, it&#x27;s very simple to use as a guest program (pseudo code):

<pre><code class=''>    // Get a pointer to the new allocation.
    let pointer = sbrk(0);
    // Actually allocate it.
    if sbrk(size) != 0 {
        // Allocation succeeded.
        // Now `pointer` points to `size` bytes you can use.
    }
</code></pre>

This is also great for use cases like e.g. tiny smart contracts which can use this as directly as an allocator without having to bring a heavyweight allocator of their own (which would consume a lot of space).

Secondly, it&#x27;s simple to implement in the VM, something like that (pseudo code again):

<pre><code class=''>fn sbrk(size) -&gt; Pointer {
    if size == 0 {
        // The guest wants to know the current heap pointer.
        return current_heap_pointer;
    }

    // The guest wants to allocate.
    let new_heap_pointer = current_heap_pointer + size;
    if new_heap_pointer &gt; max_heap_pointer {
        // Allocation failed.
        return 0;
    }


    let next_page_boundary = align_to_page_size(current_heap_pointer);
    if new_heap_pointer &gt; next_page_boundary {
        allocate_new_pages(next_page_boundary..align_to_page_size(new_heap_pointer));
    }

    current_heap_pointer += size;
    return current_heap_pointer;
</code></pre>

And this (along with the memory map I came up with, which is what we now call &quot;standard program initialization&quot;) also makes in very easy to write an interpreter for this, because when handling loads/stores from memory you only have to do something like this:

<pre><code class=''>fn load_value32(address) -&gt; value {
    if address &gt;= stack_address &amp;&amp; address + 4 &lt;= stack_address_end {
        return stack[address - stack_address];
    } else if address &gt;= rw_data_address &amp;&amp; address + 4 &lt;= align_to_page_size(current_heap_pointer) {
        return rw_data[address - stack_address];
    } else if address &gt;= ro_data_address &amp;&amp; address + 4 &lt;= ro_data_address_end {
        return ro_data[address - stack_address];
    } else {
        // Address is inaccessible.
        return Err;
    }
}
</code></pre>

It&#x27;s cheap, fast, and doesn&#x27;t require any crazy data structures and doesn&#x27;t require any handling of corner cases (for example, accesses which could read both from the stack and from RW data don&#x27;t have to be handled, because they&#x27;re impossible by definition; the interpreter can just keep them in separate arrays, and call it a day).

So that&#x27;s how (any why) it __was__ originally designed, but then came JAM and changed things. (: (Again, remember, I started working on this **before** JAM, and some things were just grandfathered into JAM.)

What JAM introduces is a concept of inner VMs (see <code>machine</code>, <code>peek</code>, <code>poke</code>, <code>invoke</code> and <code>expunge</code> host functions in section B.8 of the GP) where one VM can spawn another VM, and as it is currently designed those inner VMs are extremely flexible and have completely free-form memories and are dynamically paged.
What this essentially means is that all of those nice properties of <code>sbrk</code> that I&#x27;ve listed - simple and easy to implement, fast, doesn&#x27;t require fancy data structures - they all now go out of the window!

So we will probably be replacing <code>sbrk</code> with something else that&#x27;s more appropriate for the more flexible inner VM model. And unfortunately also most likely orders of magnitude harder to implement (at least if you want to reach at least the half-speed milestone), but it is what it is. I&#x27;m still finishing some other stuff up, but I&#x27;ll most likely be working on this soon-ish. (If any of you have any good and/or crazy ideas feel free to message me!) <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

In addition to the usual corrections/clarifications, this contains a couple of modest but important changes:
- Erasure-coding is now validator-major not chunk-major: this optimizes the happy case (where you have the first 342 validator&#x27;s shares) and doesn&#x27;t really affect the general case.
- There&#x27;s a new item in chi (privileged services) for managing always-accumulate services and how much gas they get. The three privileged services *no longer always-accumulate implicitly*.</div>

1. The remaining bits (i.e. the remaining <code>bitLength % 8</code>)  should be set to 0 (and decoding should fail in other case)
2. The boolean discriminator can be only <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>, so any other number should fail the decoding.</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-09-12 08:24</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: The remaining bits in the PVM code blob&#x27;s bitmask (in case the size of the instructions&#x27; slice is not divisible by 8) don&#x27;t really matter and will produce the same result (as all out of bounds instructions are assumed to be traps, and regardless of what skip they have they will decode all the same), <em>except</em> the very first &quot;extra&quot; out of bounds bit which nominally should be <code>1</code>, because that bit determines the skip of the last instruction. So just assuming they&#x27;re all zeros would screw up decoding of the last instruction in case the instructions&#x27; slice is divisible by 8.

But you&#x27;re right that there&#x27;s discrepancy here between the GP and the test vectors. It essentially boils down to this: what should we do if the number of instructions is not divisible by 8? Naively reading the GP the <code>|c| = |k|</code> would suggest to me that the number of bits in the bit mask should be always equal to the number of instruction bytes, but that indeed is not the case for our current test vectors.

So how do we fix this discrepancy? First, even if the number of instruction bytes is divisible by 8 we need to assume that out of bounds bits are <code>1</code> (only the very first one needs to be, but it&#x27;s simpler to assume all of them are), otherwise the decoding of the last instruction will be broken (alternatively skip can be defined to be &quot;the number of <code>0</code>s until the next <code>1</code>s, or until the end of the bitmask&quot;, then conceptually the out of bounds bits can be <code>0</code>).

Second, decide what to do when the number of instruction bytes is not divisible by 8:
a) change the <code>|c| = |k|</code> to say that the <code>|c|</code> should be rounded up to the nearest 8 (so, essentially, &quot;round_up_to_nearest(8, instruction_bytes) == bits_in_bitmask&quot;); essentially, allow the number of instructions and the number of bits in the bitmask not match, but enforce that the bitmask can have at most an &quot;extra&quot; 7 bits of padding (of which, as I&#x27;ve previously explained, only the first bit matters)
b) delete the <code>|c| = |k|</code> (since AFAIK we always know the length of the whole **p** anyway, so the only purpose this equation serves is to add an additional constraint); essentially, allow the number of instructions and the number of bits in the bitmask not match, and not enforce anything about the bitmask&#x27;s length
c) force the instruction bytes to be always divisible by 8, in which case we could change the encoding of the **p** code blob to something like <code>p = E(|j|) ⌢ E_1(z) ⌢ E_z (j) ⌢ E(c) ⌢ E(k)</code> (basically remove <code>E(|c|)</code>, since, again, the lengths here can be implicitly calculated from the length of **p**)

So I think (b) is probably not a great idea. (a) is what I currently have implemented in PolkaVM, and I don&#x27;t dislike the (c) option (It can waste up to 6 bytes, but it doesn&#x27;t need any extra validation of the sizes. so one less place for the implementations to diverge I guess). gav </div>

We have a bit in the bit mask for every instruction, right? But we can&#x27;t just encode singular bits; we need to <em>physically</em> encode them as bytes. So if we have, say, an instructions blob which only takes 2 bytes of space, then sure, theoretically we only need 2 bits in the bit mask, but practically we must encode full 8 bits because 8 bits is the lowest granularity we can store.

1. this being an implicit requirement can be confusing for the implementers (as we&#x27;ve seen from the questions here; it might not be entirely obvious to everyone that those should be zeros, nor whether this should be validated), so it could be worthwhile to add a clarifying footnote or something explicitly saying this so that there&#x27;s no room for confusion,
2. for the PVM code blob specifically this breaks the decoding of the very last instruction&#x27;s skip value, _unless_ we say that the the skip calculation goes only as far as the end of the bitmask (so effectively implicitly the bitmask would have a <code>1</code> in there because it would behave as if there actually was a <code>1</code> encoded there, even though we&#x27;d physically require encoding <code>0</code>s there!) <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

So, again, if the implicit assumption is that those extra physical bits in a bitstream must be zero then that doesn&#x27;t work for PVM as currently defined, and we need to fix it somehow.

One simple way we could fix it is to invert the bitmask (so change the <code>1</code> to <code>0</code> in the skip equation) at a tiny cost to performance (~0.006% worse compilation speed as I just implemented it and measured); if that&#x27;s fine to you then we can go with that.</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-09-12 10:03</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: Okay, sure, but the bits <em>are</em> physically there, so it needs to be defined somehow (implicitly or explicitly) how they are handled. Are they validated (enforced to be zero) or are they ignored? The protocol <em>will</em> physically transmit those bytes, so it needs to define how they&#x27;re handled (even if, again, this definition is only implicit and not explicitly written out). So I disagree that this is in any way an implementation-only concern. It&#x27;s just a matter of whether the spec defines what happens explicitly or implicitly.

Like, for example, let&#x27;s take this pseudo code as an example:

<pre><code class=''>a = spawn_pvm(instructions = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], bitmask = [0b11111110])
b = spawn_pvm(instructions = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], bitmask = [0b11111111])
</code></pre>

We need the behaviour of this snippet to be the same for every implementation, hence the spec must define what happens here. Sure, the spec doesn&#x27;t explicitly have to concern itself whether the last bit is there, but it needs to at least implicitly define (as a consequence of what it <em>does</em> explicitly define) exactly what happens, whether that be just ignoring the extra bits, or checking whether the extra bits are zero and if not then rejecting the program. If you want to say &quot;this concern is too low level for the the spec to explicitly define, and we will only define it implicitly&quot; then okay, fair enough.

Anyway, so, can we change the bitmask for the skip to be the other way around - <code>0</code>s for instructions and <code>1</code>s for the argumets? That should resolve the issue with only a minimal hit to the performance of any potential implementations and not require any extra modifications.</div>

Okay, thank you for clarifying everything. Now I&#x27;m clear on the intended behavior. Sorry for being so dense. (:

So the skip equation should be fixed, as it current does access out of bounds elements of <code>k</code> as far as I understand: <code>j∈N∶ k_{i+1+j} = 1</code> (since <code>j</code> is <code>∈N</code>, so it goes up to infinity, but even without this it would do an out-of-bounds access for the very last instruction due to the <code>+1</code>)

And we might consider deleting/changing this sentence which precedes the skip equation as it explicitly talks about the extra padding. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s incorrect (logically it&#x27;s true), but in the context of our &quot;there are no extra bits&quot; conversation it may be confusing when (outside of the serialization codec section) you have a sentence which explicitly says that those bits do in fact exist:

&gt; We assert that the length of the bitmask is no smaller than the length of the instruction blob (and in fact is simply rounded to the nearest multiple of eight for ease of octet-encoding).

So, let me quickly summarize the main options that I can see:

a) change <code>skip</code> to not read out of bounds,
b) keep <code>skip</code> as-is, define out of bounds reads to be <code>1</code> (after all we already do something similar with the instructions blob),
c) keep <code>skip</code> as-is, define out of bounds reads to be <code>1</code>, use a dedicated serialization codec for this bit mask which requires that <code>|k| mod 8 = 0</code> and <code>ceil(|c| / 8) = |k| / 8</code> (so this would make the business logic explicitly use the &quot;extra&quot; bits, which now I know you don&#x27;t want)

I can make a PR to the GP. I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;d like to go with (a), correct?

(For reference, I&#x27;ve initially implemented (c) in PolkaVM because that was marginally the fastest option which didn&#x27;t require adding any extra unnecessary padding.)</div>

Correct. The test vectors currently assume that every instructions costs <code>1</code> gas, but this is just a strictly temporary measure so that people can implement their gas metering machinery without needing the final gas cost model to be defined (since gas is a core part of the JAM you must have at least <em>some</em> gas cost model, and assuming every instruction costs only <code>1</code> gas is the simplest one you can have). We will be defining a proper gas cost model in the future and updating the vectors.</div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-09-16 06:36</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: To make this equation a little more clear, here&#x27;s a visualization of what it does. It essentially encodes numbers as varints in the following way:

<pre><code class=''>At most  7bit - 0xxxxxxx
At most 14bit - 10xxxxxx xxxxxxxx
At most 21bit - 110xxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx
...
At most 56bit - 11111110 xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx
At most 64bit - 11111111 xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx
</code></pre>

So the first encoded byte tells you how long the encoded number is by the amount of <code>1</code>s either until the first <code>0</code> (starting at the most significant bit) or until the end of the byte. If there&#x27;s &quot;free space&quot; left after the first <code>0</code> then part of the number is packed in there (the <code>x</code>s in the first byte). And then the rest of the bits of the encoded number are appended (the <code>x</code>s after the first byte). So as you can see the number of <code>x</code> bits is always divisible by <code>7</code> (hence why you can find the <code>7l</code> in the GP equation), except the very last case where we don&#x27;t have to encode the <code>0</code> in the first byte anymore because we&#x27;ll hit the end of the byte when counting the <code>1</code>s when decoding anyway (hence the &quot;otherwise if x &lt; 2^64&quot; part in the GP).

Here are some example numbers encoded using this:
<pre><code class=''>number -&gt; encoded as
01111111 -&gt; 01111111 (127 -&gt; [127])
10000000 -&gt; 10000000, 10000000 (128 -&gt; [128, 128])
00111111_11111111 -&gt; 10111111, 11111111 (16383 -&gt; [63, 255])
</code></pre>

So if you&#x27;re maybe familiar with the &quot;standard&quot; uleb128 varint serialization scheme - this is essentially similar, except instead of putting the continuation bits in every byte it packs all of the continuation bytes in the first byte and limits the number to at most 64-bit. (The rationale for this is that this is more efficient to decode on modern CPUs, because you only need to look at the first byte to know the length of the varint, instead of having to check the most significant bit for every byte.)

Hopefully this makes it a little more clear.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-09-19 15:09</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c457c5'>vinsystems</span>: In the last example

Don&#x27;t should be <code>16383 -&amp;gt; [191, 255]</code> ?
In this case, <code>l = 1</code> 
Acording with (272): 16383 -&gt; 2⁸ - 2⁷ + (16383/2⁸) = 191

<div class='msg'><time>2024-09-17 13:08</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#db4dca'>celadari</span>: Hi,

I have a question regarding state Merkelization. We say we use a Patricia trie, but looking at equation 295, it seems there are no extension nodes for common prefixes, which looks more like a regular prefix trie with Merkle hashing.

Could you confirm if my understanding is correct? If so, (we want a Patricia trie), wouldn’t we need to define l and r using b_t1 and b_t0, where t1 and t0 are the largest common prefix among paths starting with 1 and 0, respectively?</div>

As GP mentioned, the four entry points (0 (isAuthorized), 5 (Refine), 10 (Accumulate) and 15 (OnTransfer)) will pass through Ψ M -&gt; Ψ H -&gt; Ψ -&gt; Ψ 1.

My question is: What is the relationship between these four entry points and the PVM&#x27;s instruction counter? Will these different entry points affect the PVM&#x27;s instruction counter? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-09-18 01:06</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: The instruction counter is initialised with the entry point. </div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-09-18 02:57</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: To give more backround on this: the way this will work <em>in practice</em> is that the program will have 4 unconditional jump instructions at the very start, and the first 3 of those instructions will be encoded in such a way as to be padded and always take up 5 bytes of space. Hence the entry points of 0, 5, 10 and 15. This design allows for hardcoded addresses for each of the entry points without having to specify them dynamically anywhere in the protocol.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-09-18 03:03</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: (And just to be clear in case it isn&#x27;t obvious: as a PVM implementation you don&#x27;t and shouldn&#x27;t care about this, and this shouldn&#x27;t be handled in any special way on the VM level. You&#x27;re supposed to set your instruction counter to the hardcoded address of the entry point, and just start execution from there, regardless of what exactly happens to be there. The fact that there will be usually unconditional jump instructions there is just an implementation detail, and is not in any way required by the GP.)</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-09-24 08:59</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c9419d'>davxy</span>: The public key for the scheme consists of two public elements, each corresponding to one of the two groups used by BLS for pairing: G1 and G2. Specifically, it is represented as (g1 <em> sk, g2 </em> sk), where g1 is the generator of G1 and g2 is the generator of G2. Each point in G1 is compressed into 48 bytes, while each point in G2 is compressed into 96 bytes. This scheme allows for fast verification of aggregate signatures (which are very useful for bridges). In particular the G1 component allows for aggregate signature correctness verification without the need for N expensive pairings, with N the number of aggregated signatures.

With assurance, you actually check signatures on-chain, so you need to select which of the two sets those sigs refer to. Auditing doesn&#x27;t happen inside a block. No audit signatures are routinely checked on-chain (judgements are the exception, and these are intentionally drawn from the prior set). Auditing happens _between_ blocks. So there really isn&#x27;t a prior or posterior. There&#x27;s just the &quot;current&quot; validator key set. I suppose that could be phrased as the posterior of the block associated with the timeslot at the point that the auditing process began. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

We presumably need to pick one of these to be the validator set that is expected to audit the block? I don&#x27;t understand how you could just use the &quot;current&quot; validator set as (a) there is no consensus over this and (b) auditing is stateful and thus we presumably need the same validator set throughout the whole auditing process for a block?</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-09-30 23:18</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: So both auditing and block STF happen in the context of some pre-existing chain-head and its implied (posterior) state. In the context of the the block STF (which essentially validates a candidate child-block and determines the implied (posterior) state), then we now have two states - the old implied state and the new implied state. I call these two the prior and the posterior, since one is the state before the STF and the other is after the effects of the STF. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-09-30 23:18</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Auditing is not an STF.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-09-30 23:19</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: There is only one state to consider: the former. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-09-30 23:20</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Now, depending on how you argue, this could be named the prior or the posterior. But the reality is that neither name is sensible. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-09-30 23:23</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: AFAIK I never actually specify either term in the section on auditing (nor should I have).

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-10 13:01</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: Do you mean that there is extra gas charged on top of the 1 gas that the instruction costs normally?

If so then that&#x27;s a bug. Nevertheless, it doesn&#x27;t really matter what PolkaVM does here. PolkaVM is <em>not</em> a reference implementation of the GP; it&#x27;s just <em>an</em> implementation, so you need to remember that just because PolkaVM does something it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s correct. :P</div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-10 13:20</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: In that case this is expected behavior.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-10 13:21</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: The gas cost model in general is still a work-in-progress, so this is not specced in the GP yet (nor it should be considered final behavior), however the reason you&#x27;re seeing 1 extra gas being charged there is because we charge gas on an entry to a basic block, and not per instruction.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-10 13:22</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: Basically, for efficiency&#x27;s sake what we do is we calculate the gas cost for the whole basic block, and charge the whole cost at the start.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-10 13:22</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: And in that particular test case you have a load/store instruction in the middle of a basic block, so the execution gets interrupted.</div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-10 13:25</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: So charging the gas at the start of basic blocks allows us to do two things: 1) be more efficient (charging gas on each executed instruction is expensive), and 2) it should allow us to have a better gas cost model which will also take the dependencies between the instructions into account instead of only assigning static costs to each instruction in isolation</div>

Currently this isn&#x27;t really possible in JAM-SNP as the &quot;evidence&quot; for requirement to audit a work-report only covers the no-shows case. I can extend the announcement message format to support this but I&#x27;m not sure what the reason is for announcing in this case, is it actually necessary?</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-10-15 02:21</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#dbc767'>stanleyli</span>: Hi David Emett , I have read your wonderful JAMNP-S simple.md. I have a few questions and was wondering if you could answer them.

(1)Are the [Segment Shard] of CE139/140 the same as those of CE137?

(2) in CE 139, you mentioned that &quot;Guarantors should initially use protocol 139 to fetch segment shards. If a reconstructed import segment is inconsistent with its reconstructed proof&quot;. What exactly is this &quot;reconstructed proof&quot; when CE 139 only asked for [Segment Shard]? Perhaps you meant Guarantor will use [Segment Shard] retrieved from Assurer to verify against its own pageProof that it sent out during CE 137?

(3) You mentioned that guarantors will use CE139/CE140 to request import segment shards from assurers. However, Builder specify Imported segments using the combination of ({tree_root, index})[<a href="https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/blob/master/codec/data/work_package.json#L22-L35]" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/blob/master/codec/data/work_package.json#L22-L35]</a> in CE 133 and not [Erasure Root ++ Shard Index ++ len++[Segment Index]]. Should CE 139 have some alternative request format using only [segment_root ++ index]?

(4) I need clarification on how is pageProof being used in CE139/CE140? Our understanding is that page proof is quite large as it&#x27;s encoded with Justification &amp; ↕si⋅⋅⋅+64 in  <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/c71229b/1a15001a1500." target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/c71229b/1a15001a1500.</a> So it&#x27;s probably possible to recover exported segments from pageproof alone;

Do I understand this wrong?</div>

Yes. In CE137 the assurer receives a Segment Shard sequence, the CE139/140 Segment Index is an index into this sequence.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-15 11:19</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: &gt; What exactly is this &quot;reconstructed proof&quot; when CE 139 only asked for [Segment Shard]

The segments that are erasure coded consist of the segments exported by the work package _plus_ a sequence of &quot;proof&quot; pages, essentially containing Merkle proofs from the segment root to the exported segments. When you fetch an exported segment, you also need to fetch the corresponding proof to the segment root, so that you can convince yourself and auditors that the segment is correct.</div>

Should CE 139 have some alternative request format using only \[segment\_root ++ index\]

Guarantors will need to maintain a map from Segment Root to Erasure Root. This can be built from the work-reports placed on-chain / distributed via CE135. Note that an individual assurer cannot in general prove the relationship between a segment shard and the segment root, only between the shard and the erasure root. This is why for CE139/140 an erasure root is sent rather than a segment root. Note also that any segment root --&gt; erasure root mapping constructed based on reports included on-chain may have incorrect entries, as reports included on-chain are not necessarily correct. Guarantors can conclude that an erasure root was incorrect if after fetching all shards with CE 140 and verifying all the justifications, the reconstructed segment and proof do not match up. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

The proof pages contain Merkle proofs from the segment root to the exported segments. Each proof page/segment contains proofs for 64 exported segments. You certainly can&#x27;t reconstruct the exported segments themselves from these proof pages. CE139/140 is intended to be used to fetch proof page shards as well as exported segment shards. You need to explicitly request proof page shards by passing the appropriate segment indices.</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-10-21 03:08</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: I am likely missing a crucial point or important detail concerning the idea that guarantors, in order to use CE139/CE140, every validator must maintain a map from every Segment Root to Erasure Root -- this now requires every validator to become a indexer of pretty much a month&#x27;s worth of work packages&#x27;s work reports to be able to be guarantors.   No problem in indexing a month&#x27;s worth of ImportDA actiity, but validator need to take every single work report across all of JAM, and index ALL the _potential_ segment roots to Erasure Roots just to be able to _maybe_ fetch some import segment in some future work package&#x27;s work items -- Could this be??   If so, what is the simplest process to map an on-chain work report to all its segment roots _without_  auditing the work report?

As of 0.4.x, imported segments can now also be specified in a SECOND way with $H^\\boxplus$ as (work package hash, segment index) combinations, and further requires that validators build a lookup dictionary mapping these into segment roots.  But given CE139 has <code>[Erasure-Root ++ Shard Index ++ len++[Segment Index]]</code> as the request key, it seems that this second way to specify imported segments is (a) sufficient for builders to specify import segments ... and (b) has far lower indexing requirements because validators just need to store a months worth of workpackagehash =&gt; erasure-Root mappings to use CE139 (which are just sitting in the work report!).  Would it be reasonable to drop the first &quot;older&quot; way with segmentroot and just keep this SECOND method as the sole method to specify imported segments in a work package?  If not, why not?

I must have missed something crucial here...  Thank you for your help! <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Is this implied/stated in the GP somewhere?  If not, it should be added or made more explicit?

Well, &quot;more than an epoch old&quot; is not exact. The GP is quite explicit about what work reports are valid for inclusion in a block and what happens to them after this point. The WP hash -&gt; segment root mapping is checked at accumulation time, against the history of accumulated work packages, lower-case xi. This happens in the E function with the &quot;x u w_l = w_l u x&quot; check. The history is a circular buffer of length E (= timeslots per epoch), with one entry pushed every block. So it can store _at least_ one epoch&#x27;s worth of history but possibly more if there are &quot;missing&quot; blocks</div>

As far as I can tell, I could have an old work package hash from a long time ago -- &quot;whereas a value drawn from H⊞ implies the hash value is
the hash of the exporting work-package. In the latter case, it must be converted into a segment-root by the guarantor and this conversion reported in the work-report for on-chain validation.&quot;   If you believe this last statement is only applied for around an epoch (with the circular buffer mechanics, as you mention) then we should ensure this is clear in GP, don&#x27;t you think?</div>

The guarantor will not be punished for introducing a WR with an old/unvalidatable SR lookup entry. They might just not get rewarded.
And it beyond the scope of the GP (at least currently) to go deep into the optimum strategies across all off-chain behaviour. </div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-10-22 11:14</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#73caa8'>dvladco</span>: Hello, I am struggling to understand appendix A.7 more specifically I can&#x27;t find the explanation for a bunch of variables like <code>o</code>, <code>w</code>, <code>z</code>, <code>s</code> in formula <code>260</code> and later <code>a</code>, <code>W</code>, <code>R</code>, <code>V</code>, <code>A</code> in formula <code>264</code>. I have managed to decode RAM but mainly looking at the polkavm rust implementation however I don&#x27;t understand how to decode the registers from the program code <code>p</code></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-22 11:27</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: The formula (264) defines the memory map of the standard program initialization (that is: what is put at a given memory address, whether it&#x27;s initialized, whether it&#x27;s read-only/read-write, etc.). The formula (260) is essentially the standard JAM &quot;program blob&quot;. You don&#x27;t decode the registers from **p** (260); the initial values of the registers are given in (265).</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-22 11:54</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#73caa8'>dvladco</span>: Yeah, that would make sense however I got confused by this sentance:
&quot;We thus define the standard program code format p, which includes not only the instructions and jump table (pre-
viously represented by the term c), but also information on the state of the ram and registers at program start&quot;</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-22 11:56</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#73caa8'>dvladco</span>: here it says that we get registers from program code p and later in the formula 259 we have this <code>Y(p) -&amp;gt; (c, ω, μ)?</code> <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-22 12:19</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: The wording here might be a little confusing as-is. The initial registers are defined as part of the standard program initialization (eq. 265), but they&#x27;re <em>not</em> explicitly part of the program blob (eq. 260). The Y in eq. 259 is meant to represent the standard program initialization, but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that the values of the registers are directly extracted from **p**.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-22 12:46</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#73caa8'>dvladco</span>: Thank you, this explanation makes sense, also formula 266 shows <code>a</code> as separate from <code>p</code>.

 I have written a toy example here: <a href="https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/blob/skalman--add-sage-toy-example/erasure_coding/sage/spec.sage#L35" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/blob/skalman--add-sage-toy-example/erasure_coding/sage/spec.sage#L35</a> it erasure code m1 = 0x0001 and m2 = 0x0002 if it helps.

<div class='msg'><time>2024-10-30 11:48</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c9419d'>davxy</span>: Currently, JAMNP does not incorporate any Beefy-related messaging. This gadget will need to be implemented on top of GRANDPA, which itself is not described by JAMNP yet.
I would tentatively assume that the protocol won’t diverge _significantly_ from the one described for Polkadot. Of course, there are some differences, such as constructing the MMR with accumulation outputs, and using only BLS instead of BLS or ECDSA for signatures. However, for context, there are numerous introductory resources on these concepts available.
Regarding the state of the &quot;BEEFY Distribution&quot; section in GP, it currently suggests signing each finalized block B. I&#x27;m not sure if this will later shift to a &quot;sign every X blocks&quot; approach similar to Beefy on Polkadot.
The signatures are for sure BLS signatures, which can be later aggregated for efficient light client verification. Aggregated signatures will necessitate an aggregated key, and APK proofs might be introduced to verify the validity of these aggregated keys (there is at least a talk and one excellent tutorial from Syed  online).
Who is in charge of aggregation of BLS keys in JAM? Who is in charge of maintaining the keys commitment eventually required for APK proofs? Probably this aspect is outside of the core JAM protocol per se.
These aspects likely warrants further discussion, and it is probably not worth for you (or anyone else) to focus on it right now, given that GRANDPA is not on M1, and potentially not even on M2 either, meaning BEEFY is further down the line (it may be the last component indeed). I believe further details will be provided when the time is appropriate. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-10-31 10:48</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: Below are some basic questions on Ordered Accumulation and Prerequisites.  

*Background*. Lets say we wish to compute $C[n + 1] = A[n] + B[n] + C[n]$ (some kind of recurrence relationship, lets say Fibonacci, Tribonnaci, and Quadranocci in a toy example, all of $A$, $B$, $C$ trying to write their value into service storage of key 0) using the <code>refine</code> work results of services $A[n]$, $B[n]$, $C[n]$ coming into <code>accumulate</code>.  We would like service $C$ to be able to <code>read</code> the results of $A, B, C$ and <code>write</code> out $C[n+1]$ to the service storage of $C$ in $C$&#x27;s <code>accumulate</code> code.    

Questions:

1. If we have a _single_ work package $p$ with 3 work items from service $A$, $B$, $C$ (with no prerequisites), there is **NO** way to have $C$&#x27;s <code>write</code> _guaranteed_ to happen **AFTER** $A$ and $B$. This is because $\Delta_{+}$ will initialize _parallelized_ execution of $\Delta_1$ for all 3 services through $\Delta_*$.  Can you confirm this?

2. If we have _three_ work packages $p_A, p_B, p_C$ with 1 work item each ($p_A$ with <code>refine</code> work results from service A, $p_B$ from service $B$, $p_C$ from $C$), we **CAN** have C&#x27;s <code>write</code> happen after A and B, by specifying BOTH $p_A$ and $p_B$ as _prerequisite_ work packages of $p_C$.  This SET of TWO prereqs was not possible until GP 0.4.5 supporting a _set_ of prerequisites.  Can you confirm this?

3. If (2) is correct, for the $C[n + 1] = A[n] + B[n] + C[n]$ <code>write</code> to happen _at the same time slot_ for some <code>n</code>, then another to happen within 2 timeslots for the next <code>n</code>, we **REQUIRE** _three_ cores for _three_ work packages, one core for each work package.  In a tiny $V=6,C=2$ test configuration, we CANNOT achieve this, but in a small configuration with $V=9,C=3$, we CAN.  Can you confirm this?

4. Actually, the answer to (3) is more nuanced!   Because we could actually solve this ordered accumulation $C[n + 1] = A[n] + B[n] + C[n]$ with only TWO cores working on TWO packages -- one package $p_{A,B}$ with 2 work items using services $A$ and $B$ and then another package $p_C$ with ONE prerequisite: $p_{A,B}$.  Then with a tiny $V=6,C=2$ test configuration, we CAN achieve the <code>read</code> of $C$ based on the <code>write</code>s of $A$ and $B$ all in one <code>accumulate</code> at the same time slot.  Can you confirm this?

5. With a tiny testnet of $V=6,C=2$, it IS possible test (4) using $\Delta_+$ with $i$ splitting ${\bf w}$ into two pieces that test $\Delta_*$ and the tail recursion of $\Delta_+$.  To observe $N$ calls to $\Delta_+$, you need $N-1$ cores though and need to figure out how to manage $g$ in $N$ splits.  Can you confirm this? 

    [If this is wrong, please advise how we should test $\Delta_+$]

6. Setting aside gas limits for a while (because at present anyway every operation is gas 1 or so, and the accumulation limit is 5-6 orders of magnitude higher) we can have 25 cores working on 25 work packages like this all in one <code>accumulate</code> of <code>Z[n+1]</code>, with each work package having 2 prerequisites (except for $p_{A,B}$ which have none):

  * $C[n + 1] = A[n] + B[n] + C[n]$ ($p_C$ depending on $p_{A,B}$ using 2 cores)
  * $D[n + 1] = B[n] + C[n+1] + D[n]$       ($p_D$ depending on $p_{A,B}$ and $p_{C}$ using 1 more core for $D$)
  * $E[n + 1] = C[n+1] + D[n+1] + E[n]$     ($p_E$ depending on $p_{C}$ and $p_{D}$ using 1 more core for $E$)
  * $F[n + 1] = D[n+1] + E[n+1] + F[n]$     ($p_F$ depending on $p_{D}$ and $p_{E}$ using 1 more core for $F$)
  * ... and so on until ...
  * $Z[n + 1] = X[n+1] + Y[n+1] + Z[n]$     ($p_Z$ depending on $p_{X}$ and $p_{Y}$ using 1 more core for $Z$)

  Assuming all 25 cores can complete their 25 refines and get 25 work reports guaranteed and assured in a medium configuration ($V=120,C=40$), we can have the entire ordered accumulation done in ONE timeslot.  Can you confirm this?

Because there is a lot of formatting that github treats at least somewhat better also putting it here <a href="https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/issues/129" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/issues/129</a> -- is that better?</div>

This SET of TWO prereqs was not possible until GP 0.4.5 supporting a _set_ of prerequisites.  Can you confirm this?
&gt; 
&gt; 3. If (2) is correct, for the $C[n + 1] = A[n] + B[n] + C[n]$ <code>write</code> to happen _at the same time slot_ for some <code>n</code>, then another to happen within 2 timeslots for the next <code>n</code>, we **REQUIRE** _three_ cores for _three_ work packages, one core for each work package.  In a tiny $V=6,C=2$ test configuration, we CANNOT achieve this, but in a small configuration with $V=9,C=3$, we CAN.  Can you confirm this?
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Actually, the answer to (3) is more nuanced!   Because we could actually solve this ordered accumulation $C[n + 1] = A[n] + B[n] + C[n]$ with only TWO cores working on TWO packages -- one package $p_{A,B}$ with 2 work items using services $A$ and $B$ and then another package $p_C$ with ONE prerequisite: $p_{A,B}$.  Then with a tiny $V=6,C=2$ test configuration, we CAN achieve the <code>read</code> of $C$ based on the <code>write</code>s of $A$ and $B$ all in one <code>accumulate</code> at the same time slot.  Can you confirm this?
&gt; 
&gt; 5. With a tiny testnet of $V=6,C=2$, it IS possible test (4) using $\Delta_+$ with $i$ splitting ${\bf w}$ into two pieces that test $\Delta_*$ and the tail recursion of $\Delta_+$.  To observe $N$ calls to $\Delta_+$, you need $N-1$ cores though and need to figure out how to manage $g$ in $N$ splits.  Can you confirm this? 
&gt; 
&gt;     [If this is wrong, please advise how we should test $\Delta_+$]
&gt; 
&gt; 6. Setting aside gas limits for a while (because at present anyway every operation is gas 1 or so, and the accumulation limit is 5-6 orders of magnitude higher) we can have 25 cores working on 25 work packages like this all in one <code>accumulate</code> of <code>Z[n+1]</code>, with each work package having 2 prerequisites (except for $p_{A,B}$ which have none):
&gt; 
&gt;   * $C[n + 1] = A[n] + B[n] + C[n]$ ($p_C$ depending on $p_{A,B}$ using 2 cores)
&gt;   * $D[n + 1] = B[n] + C[n+1] + D[n]$       ($p_D$ depending on $p_{A,B}$ and $p_{C}$ using 1 more core for $D$)
&gt;   * $E[n + 1] = C[n+1] + D[n+1] + E[n]$     ($p_E$ depending on $p_{C}$ and $p_{D}$ using 1 more core for $E$)
&gt;   * $F[n + 1] = D[n+1] + E[n+1] + F[n]$     ($p_F$ depending on $p_{D}$ and $p_{E}$ using 1 more core for $F$)
&gt;   * ... and so on until ...
&gt;   * $Z[n + 1] = X[n+1] + Y[n+1] + Z[n]$     ($p_Z$ depending on $p_{X}$ and $p_{Y}$ using 1 more core for $Z$)
&gt; 
&gt;   Assuming all 25 cores can complete their 25 refines and get 25 work reports guaranteed and assured in a medium configuration ($V=120,C=40$), we can have the entire ordered accumulation done in ONE timeslot.  Can you confirm this?
&gt; 
&gt; Because there is a lot of formatting that github treats at least somewhat better also putting it here <a href="https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/issues/129" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/issues/129</a> -- is that better?

1: This condition: <code>if h ≠ ∇ ∧ (h, z) /∈ (x_s)l</code> I assume should be <code>if h ≠ ∇ ∧ (h, z) /∈ K((x_s)l)</code> since <code>l</code> is a dictionary so here we are trying to verify if the key is in the dictionary

2: one line bellow here: <code>if (x_s)l[(h, z)] = [x, y]</code> I can&#x27;t figure out where do the _x_ and _y_ (italic) come from? (edit and _t_ as well) <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Yes this is the case I was imagining. Of course this assumes it is _possible_ to make the WP available at an arbitrary later point. It&#x27;s not obvious to me that this wouldn&#x27;t be possible. If you wait long enough to do this then auditors will be able to assemble the bundle but may not be able to check the report because they have discarded necessary state. What then?</div>

Can state-key constructor functions C be enhanced with a &quot;type&quot; identifier? something like:

<pre><code class=''>(i ∈ N28, t ∈ N2) ↦ [i, 0, 0, . . . ,t]
(i, s ∈ NS, t ∈ N2) ↦ [i, n0, 0, n1, 0, n2, 0, n3, 0, 0, . . . ,t] where n = E4(s) 
(s, h, t) ↦ [n0, h0, n1, h1, n2, h2, n3, h3, h4, h5, . . . , h26, t] where n = E4(s)

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-11-27 01:36</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: Since CE129 is not intended for debug purposes but for warp-sync, this issue is not relevant, thank you.  Closed the issue =). But the general need for a state representation for STF testing (and debugging state) is still there.

For the syncing problem, we do need a clear understanding of how implementations should do the warp sync with CE129 and how AuditDA (1 hour) and ImportDA (28 days) should work at similar timescales, right? We imagine syncing could be skipped for AuditDA but ImportDA cannot.  We doubt teams need to implement it until getting through M1+M2, right?

We should spec out the RPC endpoints (with JSON request/responses) to cover the debugging case of state sharing without regard to CE 129 warp syncing... and the top 10 others.   <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-11-27 03:35</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: A new validator who joins a JAM network has to get all chunks associated with its validator index -- for both AuditDA (1 hour) and ImportDA (28 days).  For Audit DA, if there is some upper bound on how many new validators can join (not sure about where this will happen) then within an hour of participating its up to date -- so a new validator could &quot;skip&quot; this Audit DA syncing operation since there is so much redundancy.    Or it could look through the last hours worth of work reports and ask the guarantors for its chunks.

But for Import DA, the new validator should have some fast way of getting all the chunks its responsible for holding.  It could look through the last 28 days of work reports and ask the guarantors for its chunks .. but I am not sure that it can.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-11-27 09:16</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: Where did you get that from? Once enough validators claim receipt of their shards I do not believe there is any requirement for the guarantors of a report to send out more shards. There is also no mechanism for validators to report that they have obtained the shards after this point, although you could argue that isn&#x27;t really necessary.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-11-27 16:47</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: Consider the situation where on Dec 1 there is a segment exported in a V=1024 network.  Under normal conditions, up to 2/3 of the network can be dead and the segment will be available in ImportDA.

BUT if every day from Dec 1 to 11, 100 validators leave and 100 new join to take their place, in such a way that the entire network has been completely replaced, but 
(a) no one has the data to reconstruct the segment
(b) no one in the new set has used any JAMNP method to fetch their chunk from the guarantor, 
what happens?  

I think the present answer is &quot;there is no plan&quot;.

If the plan is &quot;oh we have 28 day unbonding periods&quot;, what happens with unbonding queues that are way shorter than that?

This sets my expectation that we need a way to have ImportDA syncs for a changing of the guard, where one validator takes the place of another at a specific validator index.   <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Concretely, if package M has package F as a prerequisite, because of 11.38 requirement, M can&#x27;t even get a work report in for 12.3 to matter.   Put another way, 11.38 has prereqs constraining refine of M before 12.3 accumulation can matter.  
How can we get a good test case for accumulation queue then?

2. For non-guarantors, they will only be able to assure the data based on observing a guarantee extrinsic that includes a work report.  
The majority of the network (all but 2 or 3 validators out of V) is in 2.  

So for the B-depends-on-A:
* By 11.38 requirement on reporting/guarantees, there is no way to generate a work report for B until A has a work report
* Because of 2, the majority of the network cannot provide an assurance
* Because the above &quot;the majority of the network cannot provide an assurance&quot;, we are having difficulty generating any situation where 12.3 accumulation queue is filled with anything.

What are we getting wrong in the above chain of logic?  Is there a test case where 12.3 accumulation queue is filled with anything?

Note that we ARE able to generate a test case like this:
(1) |E_G|=2, where refine of A+B are executed _in the same slot_ 
(2) |E_A|=V, where all V validators assure both A+B and then due to the &quot;B depending on A&quot; first A is accumulated (having no dependencies) then B (having a dependency on A)</div>

In auditing, we consider the report audited if the report have no negative judgement and there exists some tranche where all validators required to audit have positive judgement about the report.

In case some validator announced a audit but failed to deliver the judgement, and new audits are announced to cover that.

So, the new tranche A_n will be = old tranche auditors + new auditors just announced - auditors failed to deliver judgement ?

<div class='msg'><time>2024-12-08 03:47</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c86f85'>amritj</span>: I asked this question in Jam room, not solved there so asking here too:

Question:

The segments are erasure-coded and distributed to the validators. Each validator receives a single shard out of the 1,023 shards, determined by their validator index. Therefore, the shard index of the shard they receive equals to their validator index.

According to the JAMNP protocol, to fetch data from the assurers, we need to provide each assurer with the shard index we require from them.

The exported segments are expected to remain available for 28 days. During this period, it is assumed that more than 341 validators will remain consistent. However, there is still a significant likelihood that validator indexes may change during this time due to the addition or removal of validators.

I asked if we have to remember historical validator sets to know who to request shards from, which David Emett  confirmed

But we are not able to find any way to distribute this data to a new validator added to the network, and without this data he won&#x27;t be able to compute work reports.

I proposed to not require shard index in the request to fetch data from assurer but assurer himself give us the shard index which we can ofcourse verify is correct or not, so we only need the erasure root and segment index, but as some new validators added to the system if we randomly choose 342 assurers to request data from some of the responses will be empty so either we can request from ~400-500 validators (churn rate as confirmed by sourabhniyogi  is low, so we will most probably receive more than 342 shards) OR somehow store which validators were expected to be active in the requested WR segment epoch by storing status component like we do in preimages in the validator metadata which I am not much sure about

The above solution is only for new validators, old validators will use the normal method as they know which validators have which shard

Is this a good solution to the problem or is there a better answer we can&#x27;t see? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-12-08 04:54</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c86f85'>amritj</span>: Btw, a highly unlikely attack vector, but I&#x27;m still curious if it&#x27;s possible:

For a report to be marked valid, it goes through two checks: first, guaranteeing, and second, auditing.

To pass the guaranteeing stage, we need two guarantors to sign. To pass the auditing stage, we need all 10 randomly selected auditors to give a positive judgment about the report.

Let&#x27;s say one of the guarantors is a malicious actor and tries to bribe their fellow guarantor to sign an invalid report. The bribe would need to be large enough to offset the guarantor&#x27;s potential loss if they are found guilty. Since only one more actor needs to accept the risk and the bribe, let&#x27;s assume the other guarantor accepts the bribe.

After guaranteeing, we have to somehow pass the auditing stage. To do this, the attacker sets up an off-chain bribe market offering auditors of this report a deal: if all them don&#x27;t announce anything, and prove they are auditors of the report after the invalid report is marked valid, they will receive a huge sum of money.

The auditors face no risk even if they are the only one remaining silent, as they aren&#x27;t passing a positive judgment. If all 10 auditors stay silent and no one announces anything, the report will automatically be marked valid.

One way is after the auditor announce that they are going to audit that report, the attacker may reach all WR auditors to pass positive judgement.

But in this way, even if auditor is willing to accept the bribe he don&#x27;t know if other will do the same and have huge risk.

But if someone have built the logic to accept the bribe he is not a good auditor, and all these bad auditors can also before announcing everyone about which report they going to audit tell the bribe market about it and if bribe market found ~30 such auditors working on same report he may ask them to not send this announcment to everyone and let the report to pass, otherwise everything goes normally, this could go on for years waiting for perfect moment.

My mind was stuck that we only need to disrupt the network between validators somehow at that exact time of audit announcement making A_n empty, and pass the audit test

But the amount of validators required to pull this off is huge, and can only think of only one next to impossible case if more 95% of the validators use the same Internet Provider, and the provider performed a huge targeted attack on the jam protocol validators and stopped their communication at the exact time, not much sure about this too

David Emett: might have an opinion on this; personally I&#x27;d be tempted to store 28 days worth of historical validator key sets on-chain (full key 336 bytes, 10 validators change per epoch and 4 bytes to redirect to last change = 9 MB), as well as the 28 days of worth of entropy (32 bytes per 6 seconds = 13 MB)</div>

Index churn is somewhat problematic when considering our current EC reconstruction algorithms.

Yeah, old validators need to maintain a mapping for historical validators.

However, the following concepts might be related: CAP Theorem, Blockchain Trilemma (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/1/19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link</a>). Would not the &quot;Size-Synchrony Antagonism&quot; term be part of any of the cited ones?

Citing the Blockchain Trilemma research paper:

1. Adding more nodes increases communication overhead
2. As 𝑁 increases, 𝐿 grows at least logarithmically, potentially linearly or quadratically, depending on protocol specifics. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-12-29 08:21</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: CAP theorem comes closer since what it calls “consistency”is similar in nature to what i termed “coherency”. However each of its three concepts are binary conditions and the proof simply states that no system can fulfill all three. Furthermore it doesn’t conceptualise the size of the system directly (how could it under a binary condition?), instead going for antagonist concepts “availability” and “partition-tolerance”. As such I’d argue CAP theorem is a more concrete trilemma on specifically replicated data systems. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Some instructions simply use <code>ζı+1</code> (like <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/6e1c0cd/26a60326a603" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>), but for immediates/offsets we use <code>ℓ</code> which is mask dependent (like <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/6e1c0cd/262001262001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>).

ζ is zero-padded so it&#x27;s fine if we go beyond the program length, but what if <code>ζı+1</code> is actually the next instruction?

AFAICT from GP we should treat the instruction byte as argument (and read registers from it) and in the next step just move according to the mask (i.e. execute that instruction).
Is that expected or should there be some special casing for that in the GP?</div>

about the construction of the  segment-root dictionary l.
initially we have:
<a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/6e1c0cd/1af0011af601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K(l) ≡ {h S w ∈ pw , (h⊞, n) ∈ wi} , SlS ≤ 8</a>

this is clear enough, from the work item in a work package we take up to 8 hashes, of the kind that is the work-package hash. okie dokie.

then we come to :
∃p, c ∈ P, NC ∶ H(p) = h in <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/6e1c0cd/1ac7021aca02" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14.13</a>

which means to me one of two things

1. we have here knowledge of &quot;all&quot; the work packages (all in what scope?) or some subset/list of work packages and we go through it to find the work-pacakges that the work-items refers to

2. we only keep in the segment-root dictionary the hashes that refer to the work-pacakge paseed into work result computation function Ξ. so all the keys will be identical, H(p), but since <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/6e1c0cd/1b6c001b6c00" target="_blank" rel="noopener">s</a> as far as i can see is not dependent on the core index c. we would end up with  a dictionary of all identical key -&gt; value pairs

option 2 doesn&#x27;t make much sense, which brings me back yo option 1, but i see no reference to any list or set of work-packages <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-01-07 10:52</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4068cd'>0xjunha</span>: I have a question regarding the leaf node encoding function (<a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/911af30/37f402371103)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/911af30/37f402371103)</a> for state merklization.

In a Merkle trie, a leaf node will be typically placed at a depth less than 256, implying that it should represent the remaining, unconsumed bits of the <code>state_key</code> after navigating to that point - so that we can guess which <code>state_key</code> that leaf node represents.

When considering what the leaf node holds as the encoded state key (<code>bits(k)...248</code>), should this refer to:

a) &quot;The first 248 bits of the full 256-bit state key&quot;? Or
b) &quot;The first 248 bits of the unconsumed path bits&quot;?

For example, let&#x27;s say we have a state key like <code>0b1101_1010_1001...</code> and a leaf node is at depth 10, meaning we&#x27;ve navigated the trie using the path <code>0b1101_1010_10</code> to reach this node, should the leaf node:

a) Store the first 248 bits of <code>0b1101_1010_1001...</code>? Or
b) Only store the first 248 bits of <code>0b01...</code>, skipping the first 10 bits, thus excluding the part already used for navigation (<code>0b1101_1010_10</code>)? Actually in this case the remaining part is only 246 bits, so we have 2 bits of free space.

From my interpretation of the formalism, it seems the encoding takes the &quot;first 248 bits of the full 256-bit state key&quot; regardless of the leaf node&#x27;s position (depth), so option a), but just wanted to confirm this understanding.</div>

I believe the configuration for testnet, tiny, or small networks will remain the same because the data size will still be 684k. In all these networks, the same validator holds multiple pieces of the 1023 chunks. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-01-11 17:32</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#6de2b4'>weigen</span>: Hi, I have a question about disputes. Based on my understanding, the faults (f) in the extrinsic include validators who issued invalid judgments on a work report. Since the work report is actually valid, it should belong to the good set (Psi_g).
This logic aligns with the behavior seen in this test vector (<a href="https://github.com/davxy/jam-test-vectors/blob/polkajam-vectors/disputes/tiny/progress_with_verdicts-4.json#L82," target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/davxy/jam-test-vectors/blob/polkajam-vectors/disputes/tiny/progress_with_verdicts-4.json#L82,</a> <a href="https://github.com/davxy/jam-test-vectors/blob/polkajam-vectors/disputes/tiny/progress_with_verdicts-4.json#L191)," target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/davxy/jam-test-vectors/blob/polkajam-vectors/disputes/tiny/progress_with_verdicts-4.json#L191),</a> where work reports included in faults (f) are added to the good set of the posterior Psi. However, according to the Gray Paper (<a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/579bd12/128a01128a01)," target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/579bd12/128a01128a01),</a> the reports in faults (f) should instead be placed in the bad set (Psi_b) and not in the good set.

This creates a conflict: if the work reports in faults (f) are valid and should be part of the good set, why are they assigned to the bad set instead? My understanding is that validators who issued invalid judgments on these valid reports are placed in faults (f), but the reports themselves remain valid.

Am I interpreting this correctly, or have I missed something?</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-01-12 10:42</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: I think you are interpreting the GP incorrectly. The judgments included in faults can be either positive (ie claiming the WR is good) or negative (ie claiming it is bad). The requirement you linked (<a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/579bd12/128a01128a01)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/579bd12/128a01128a01)</a> just states that they must contradict a verdict</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-01-15 14:52</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cb735c'>prasad-kumkar</span>: For state merklization, is there a recommended approach for data ordering before constructing the Merkle tree? While I noticed the state key construction function C appears to provide some ordering through key generation, I&#x27;m unsure if:

1. This is indeed meant to determine the ordering before Merkleization
2. If so, would service indices (s) create well-distributed keys since they are sparsely distributed 32-bit integers?

I initially thought of splitting data in half recursively (like traditional Merkle trees), but noticed JAM&#x27;s approach might be different.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-01-15 16:02</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: This is a Merkle trie, so the keys (given by C) determine exactly the node structure of the tree. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-01-15 16:03</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: You don’t get to decide. “Ordering” is moot as we never iterate. But if you really want an order (eg for RPC) then you can apply dictionary ordering to the keys. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-01-15 16:05</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Service indices are sparse, as are keys generally: the function C is designed to be sparse and mostly uniform.

The current specification works good for the tiny chain spec but it may not be the best performance wise when using the full chain spec. The full chain spec will have 2046 tickets to be distributed to everyone within approx. 22 minutes (half of the lottery time and allowing 3 min for connectivity changes). This will result in 90+ incoming streams per minute for each validator just to consume tickets.</div>

1.- Is this the GP exit reason? (halt, panic, out of gas, page fault, hostcall fault)

<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-01-20 09:57</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c457c5'>vinsystems</span>: It&#x27;s a bit confusing because &quot;trap&quot; is an instruction and &quot;panic&quot; is an exit reason.

What do you do when a page fault ocurrs? Do you store the lowest address to access in a status register before executing the trap instruction to switch from PVM mode to JAM kernel mode?</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-01-20 12:51</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: I will align the naming in the next version of the test vectors to make it less confusing.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-01-20 12:55</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: For toplevel PVMs a page fault is no different than executing a &quot;trap&quot; instruction or any other condition which would result in a &quot;panic&quot; exit reason, and for those you don&#x27;t even need to know the address of the page that faulted.

For inner PVMs (those are PVMs triggered with the <code>invoke</code> hostcall) a page fault will interrupt the execution of the inner PVM and should return the address of the page which triggered the fault.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-01-20 13:00</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: And in case you&#x27;re wondering, the store instructions are atomic, so for example if the inner PVM tries to write 4 bytes into the memory, and the first two bytes end up at the 2 last bytes of page N (which was already faulted) and the last two bytes end up at the 2 first bytes of page N +1 (which was not faulted) then such a write will <em>only</em> trigger a page fault with the address of the N + 1 page and memory will not be modified.</div>

(a) don&#x27;t start the work if you&#x27;re towards the end according to rule R, because you won&#x27;t be rewarded for it!
(b) finish it because you&#x27;ll be rewarded for it!
We do believe its valuable to have this rule R or reward process specified in more detail to ensure different implementations work well together -- can we come up with a good Schelling point at this point?

Not getting the slot in the &quot;tiny&quot; network (where C is just 2, R is just 4) with &quot;big&quot; work packages (close to 12MB) makes this issue quite prominent in regression tests. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-01-26 18:40</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: Agree this will probably need to be specified at some point for different impls to work well together. I think this rule will need to be informed by the performance characteristics of a full 1000-validator network though, with real builder nodes, and we aren&#x27;t in a position to run such a network yet. I can say that at the moment our node follows a pretty simple rule: as a validator, accept a package for core C if we will be &quot;assigned&quot; to that core in the next slot or the slot after that. Note that it is possible for block authors to include packages using assignments from the previous rotation, so there is quite a bit of leeway.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-01-26 18:43</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: Given this leeway perhaps a better rule would be to allow if we&#x27;re currently assigned or will be assigned in the next slot.

<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-01-26 18:46</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: The rule should also probably be a bit more lenient for work packages received indirectly from another guarantor on the same assignment, to avoid a situation where the &quot;primary&quot; guarantor _just_ accepts a package but the guarantors it then shares it with do not.</div>

Side note, since I already had questions regarding this: you can think of every 32-bit instruction variant as _always_ taking a modulo of its inputs, even though sometimes in the GP we omit this modulo to make the equations simpler if the result would be equivalent anyway, for example in case of <code>add_32</code> the result gets truncated anyway so truncating the inputs is unnecessary. The high-level intent is to allow every 32-bit instruction variant to be implemented as follows (to allow for an efficient recompiler implementation): 1) truncate all inputs to 32-bit, 2) do the operation, 3) sign-extend to 64-bit, so if you find any equation in the GP for 32-bit instruction variants would have given a result that doesn&#x27;t match this please ping me and we&#x27;ll correct it. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Since this is not explicitly mentioned in section 3, I assume the answer is no.

<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-07 15:30</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: The lack of requirement in <code>zero</code> that the pages are inaccessible is indeed intended so that e.g. this host call can be used to clear/reinitialize memory without first having to void it nor track what is already allocated. Requiring it wouldn&#x27;t really change anything performance-wise since you have to (or the OS has to) iterate over the page map to find the holes to fill anyway. (And in practice not requiring this check can make things simpler because you can just ask the OS to zero allocate an address range in bulk instead of having to do this yourself.)

Hm, but now that I think about it we probably should make <code>void</code> not require the pages to be accessible either, as that could simplify its usage in certain cases (and, same as with <code>zero</code>, the page map has to be iterated over anyway by the implementation, whether it returns an error or not). Basically have it take a range of pages we want it to free, and when it returns it&#x27;ll guarantee that the whole range is now free. So the <code>HUH</code> error branch could just be deleted altogether (since voiding the first 64k or out-of-bounds would be a no-op as there can&#x27;t never be anything allocated there anyway).</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-09 18:55</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c9419d'>davxy</span>: AFAIK, <code>arc-ec-vrfs</code> is currently the only implementation available. This is likely because the scheme is not standardized, thus any existing implementation should be tied to JAM.

For those interested in implementing it, the details of Bandersnatch VRFs are soecified here: <a href="https://github.com/davxy/bandersnatch-vrfs-spec." target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/davxy/bandersnatch-vrfs-spec.</a> Implementing the &quot;plain&quot; VRF is **relatively** straightforward, especially with the support of a &quot;bigint&quot; library, making it a manageable task.

However, the complexity increases significantly when dealing with the ring-VRF variant. Even though it is thoroughly specified here: <a href="https://github.com/davxy/ring-proof-spec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/davxy/ring-proof-spec</a> , implementing it requires a library that supports the underlying SNARK framework it relies on. Since there are no official standards (only de facto ones, at best), you’ll likely need to build many things from scratch. 

We have been using <a href="https://arkworks.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arkworks</a> for this, as it provides **most** of the tools necessary. That said, some additional components were developed by the W3F team and ourselves to fill in the gaps anyway.

In summary, if someone is inclined to implement any of these components (also by building over arkworks, for example), I’m available to provide some support. Additionally, test vectors are available for validating conformance. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Just some question related to safrole:

Equations (6.15), (6.16), (6.17), (6.18), (6.19), (6.20) - GP version 6.2 - refer to gamma_s&#x27; and eta_3&#x27; =&gt; so we should update gamma_s and eta_3 before ?

<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-22 00:16</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#7875cf'>charliewinston14</span>: Hello.

I’m having some difficulty understanding the erasure root formula in the GP, specifically calculating “s♣” in 14.16.

Hoping someone can point me in the right direction. 

I had no problem calculating “b♣” and have my erasure coding function C and paged proof generation function P already.

The s♣ formula has C#6 (s⌢ P(s))), where S is an array and P(S) is an array as well. Does that mean to concatenate them both together and then pass to chunking function?  I think it’s the # that is confusing me as that normally means apply to each of the sub items. There is also a # on the binary merkle call so I’m assuming that I need to call the merkle function multiple times and not just once with the results of the erasure encoding but not understanding the formula at all. Can someone give me a tip of how to proceed with it?

<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-22 07:25</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#72c147'>luke_fishman</span>: I need some clarification regarding the advancement  of the instruction counter i in the PVM

Reading <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/5f542d7/23ec0023ec00" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A.1</a> and <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/5f542d7/246600246600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A.7</a>

I understand the counter i` will always advance to the next instruction unless the exit reason is panic or halts

so if we have program like
ecalli ..
op1 ...
op2 ...

host call fail =&gt; continue from op1
host call succeed =&gt; continue from op2 (due to the extra skip in [A.33] (<a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/5f542d7/2b70012b7001)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/5f542d7/2b70012b7001)</a>


However, reading the <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/5f542d7/2b16022b1602" target="_blank" rel="noopener">text</a> below A.34 i understand that

i&#x27; is:
exit reason == continue &gt; i + 1 +skip
out of gas =&gt; i
panic or halt =&gt; 0
page fault =&gt; i
host call =&gt; i


but this makes [A.33] (<a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/5f542d7/2b70012b7001)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/5f542d7/2b70012b7001)</a> not make sense

host call fail =&gt; counter stays =&gt; reinvoke into the failing host call

<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-22 07:43</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#72c147'>luke_fishman</span>: right. my code does just that. no issue

so lets talk about the case where the host call succeeds

we start with phi\_1 which returned ecalli, and i&#x27; = i +1 +skip (i.e point to instruction after the the ecalli)

and so we don&#x27;t need to advance again after the host call has succeeded. since we already point to the next instruction

or, the Phi\_1 should not advance the counter on a ecalli exit reason, and after host call finishes with success then the counter advances

basically, why the text below A.34 says the i\` point the the host call, when seems to me from A.7 that it has already progressed beyond <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Am I interpreting this correctly? The tests &amp; gh consensus suggests that the keys shouldn&#x27;t be rotated at each recursion, but rather that the $d&#x27;th bit should be used in the splitting conditional at recursion depth $d. I&#x27;m happy to open a PR to the GP repo if appropriate.

is a first try, hopefully a couple of us will try to converge on something as we get our host function implementations and PVM interpreter implementations correct.

I am wondering why R/W/0 page accessibility came to your mind right away (as opposed to X/Y contexts which has most of the immediate debugging problems) -- I must  be missing something since any discrepancy in internal representations of page accessibility would be visible by some load/store instructions effect (or lack thereof) on a particular page -- encoding this page accessibility would be for 2 teams to reason about the contents of the memory after they saw the memory affected/not affected based on R/W/0 page accessibility bits -- if you anticipate this to be quite important early, I would like to put it in early in a &quot;v1&quot; (like in a page) -- is it?

Related question maybe?:  Was the W\_G=4104 segment size chosen for segments to match a 4096-page size and a specific 8-byte encoding of the page, a page number and some specific metadata, specifically the accessibility bits.  If so, we might as well get the &quot;dump a page&quot; to map into the 4104 encoding imagined for CoreVM service with the desired 8-byte encoding for pages maybe?   <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Not sure what you mean by $omega8, but assuming you mean selecting between that latter 2 variants of B.12, then it&#x27;s pretty clear: you use the returned value IFF it is a 32-byte sequence (blackboard H). If it&#x27;s anything other than this (e.g. 31 byte sequence or 33 byte sequence), then you fallback to the _otherwise_ condition of using the (success) context&#x27;s yield. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

CoreVM-type services aim to extend JAM computation across multiple work packages by exporting PVM memory pages as segments at the end of a task and retrieving them at the start of the next.

While the <a href="https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/issues/145" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memcpy/memset host call</a> can support data transfer between parent and child VMs (an imported segment copied into some child VM page index), the parent needs a way to identify all mutated memory pages—not just those explicitly copied via memcpy—to ensure they are correctly included in the exported segments.

One approach could be extending <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/5f542d7/2d22002d2200" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M</a> to track modified page indexes and providing an explicit mechanism for the parent VM to access this set, supporting efficient page/segment export.

Is this a good idea or is there a better approach?</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-03 08:11</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4068cd'>0xjunha</span>: I have several questions/comments regarding the historical lookup and related constants:

1. The constant <code>D</code> has been updated from 28,800 slots (48 hrs) to 4,800 slots (8 hrs). I opened a PR to update it in appendix I too: <a href="https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/pull/260" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/pull/260</a>

2. Probably the constant value <code>L</code> should be reduced too? <code>D</code> seems to be introduced to prevent a preimage data from being removed while it still could be referenced during auditing. So <code>D</code> should be larger than <code>L</code>. However, current value of <code>L</code> is 14,400 (24 hrs): (<a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/5f542d7/417000417000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/5f542d7/417000417000</a> and <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/5f542d7/0c9f000c9f00)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/5f542d7/0c9f000c9f00)</a> which hasn&#x27;t been updated since the initial commit, while <code>D</code> was updated as mentioned above.

3. <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/5f542d7/113b00113b00" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/5f542d7/113b00113b00</a> Regarding the brief definition of the historical lookup function, should the constant <code>C_D</code> be <code>D</code> instead? I wonder if this is a typo or I&#x27;m missing something. Also, while the function is designed to be called off-chain, should we interpret the <code>H_t</code> here as &quot;The timeslot index of the last finalized block header that an auditor sees at the point of auditing&quot;?</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-17 10:04</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#5c84c9'>prematurata</span>: I think I&#x27;ve found something interesting when handling the <code>ecalli</code> pvm fn. According to the gp <code>ΨH|A.34</code> calls <code>Ψ()|A.1</code> and handles the  <code>ε′ = hxh</code>.

The <code>ecalli</code> fn ( <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/85129da/25ff0025ff00?v=0.6.3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/85129da/25ff0025ff00?v=0.6.3</a> )  is set to modify just <code>ε</code> leaving the default <code>ı′ = ı + 1 + skip(ı)</code> defined in A.7 in place.

Then the host call gets executed inside <code>ΨH|A.34</code>. If all goes ok and <code>f</code> returns (▸, ....) then we should recursively call <code>ΨH</code> but with <code>ı′′</code> which is defined as <code>ı′′ = ı′ + 1 + skip(ı′)</code>. Now since <code>i&amp;#x27;</code> is what is being returned by <code>Ψ</code> and is already skipping an instruction, then <code>ΨH</code> gets called by skipping another instruction (due to the 2x skips being applied).

Now i think this is either a misinterpretation of mine or an error in the graypaper as in my point of view it makes no sense to skip 1 instruction after a successful hostcall execution via ecalli. Multiple implementations seems to agree with this considering there are multiple implementors passing the duna testnet. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Then the 2048 could gets 16 or 32x times as much memory but of course 16x - 32x as much bandwidth usage.

Bigger page sizes are not great, as it means way more read/write amplification in the worst case. 4k is already really too big for a number of use cases, we just can&#x27;t really go smaller as 4k is the min page size on modern HW</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-19 19:28</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: Please note that the 12 bytes is _per segment shard requested_. You should absolutely be batching these requests so that in the ideal case you make ~340 network requests for all of the segment shards you need for a WP. This is still a lot of requests of course. In the full network protocol we may add a fast path for requesting the original data directly from guarantors.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-19 19:32</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: 12MB is a limit on the number of pages read/written _per WP_.

My mental model is that the majority of segments will come from one primary work package and occasionally a few segments come in from another few &quot;foreign&quot; wps but I understand that&#x27;s just one use case, where my mental model is formed by what I imagine a lazy CoreVM programmer would do (if you tell him its like normal programs).   

By &quot;read/write amplification&quot; I believe you mean the idea that we load up all these pages (yes, in a single WP) from Segments DA and only a tiny % of the pages are updated and only a tiny fraction of each page at that, right?  So it looks like a tradeoff between that and the number of networking calls, even with batched <code>segmentIndex</code>.   Thanks for explaining!</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-20 10:10</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: By read/write amplification I mean even if you want to read or write just 1 byte you still have to import/export an entire page/segment; you end up reading/writing 4000 times as much.

There are four better cases: that some or all of the segments are provided to the guarantors by the builder (because it could be the same builder or builder-network whose package created them in the first place). In this case they could have the proof-pages or just be content indexed and passed as extrinsics. Or the guarantor could already have the pages in their own cache because it was they who guaranteed the exporting package. Or the guarantor could fetch them from the exporting guarantor as whole segments. Or that the guarantor batches them because they were exported by the same package as other segments which are also needed for import. And in the worst case, the system wouldn&#x27;t _break_; it would just mean that packages which exposed this worst-case behaviour would take potentially a little longer to make their way through the pipeline. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-20 16:32</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#5c84c9'>prematurata</span>: I have a couple of questions/remarks about accumulation. Specifically how jam should handle dependencies when accumulating a service. Let&#x27;s consider the following scenario:

- WorkReport A contains 2 results: service 1 and service 2
- WorkReport B has a dependency on A <code>((WB)_x)_p = ((WA)_s)_h</code> and contains one result of service 3.

So <code>W!</code> contains \[1, 2\], lets assume <code>WQ</code> is empty... But <code>W*</code> contains also 3 so <code> W* = [1, 2, 3]</code>.

Now <code>∆∗</code> which is called &quot;parallelized accumulation&quot;, is being called with W\* on 12.21 (after ∆+) <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/68eaa1f/17b50317c103?v=0.6.4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/68eaa1f/17b50317c103?v=0.6.4</a> .

question 1: But since there is no ordering enforced (that i can see) when executing <code>∆∗</code>, then 3 might be executed before it&#x27;s dependencies.

question 2: lets say i am wrong in the previous question. Lets say Service 1 writes in it&#x27;s storage a key that Service 3 needs to read from (via hostcall read). service 3 does not seem to receive the updated storage when <code>∆1</code> gets called with s=3

I guess both questions/remarks are wrong and that Service3 needs to be indeed gets executed after 1,2 (which can be parallelized) and that it should be accumulated using the updated service accounts from the 1,2 accumulation. but i can&#x27;t see where this is enforced in the GP. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

It&#x27;s on my TODO list; we just don&#x27;t want to spec it before implementing it to make sure the performance is good.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-20 18:34</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: That&#x27;s totally great.  A <code>page-manifest</code>  host function call of both (A) what pages MUST be exported because it was written to (a &quot;dirty bit&quot; per page) and (B) what page MUST be imported because it was read from (a &quot;accessed&quot; bit per page) appears necessary for programmers to not have to think much about how their child &quot;guest program&quot; uses memory and the parent CoreVM service will need this manifest to poke and peek pages so the programmer doesn&#x27;t have to.

But since guest programs will vary widely in terms of how many &quot;accessed&quot; and &quot;dirty&quot; bits they get before they hit some refine gas limit OR the W\_M=3072 (12MB) limit on imported+exported segments which applies across ALL the VMs, parent and child, it seems the builder should be able to run with the whole 2^32 VMs always fully loaded ... and <em>then</em> use this bookkeeper to dump work packages out right before it runs out of gas or hit the W_M, to effectively break up long running computations into work packages that the guarantors can legit handle in accordance with JAM spec.   We would thus want &quot;builder&quot; mode refining (having tens of thousands maybe the 1MM page) and &quot;guarantor&quot; model refining (W\_M) working on just the subset the builder wants.  Is that the way to think about designing this host function?  How do performance considerations figure in? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-25 21:03</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: I read David Emett &#x27;s comment of &quot;12MB is a limit on the number of pages read/written per WP. It is not the limit on the CoreVM memory.&quot; in the following way:

- A CoreVM service user actually really does have a 4GB virtual computer.  However, in any given work package, spanning say a few seconds of computation only	a small number of pages are accessed (imported) or written to (exported).
- Only W\_M (3072 as of 0.6.4) pages = 12MB of this 4GB virtual computer is realistic to set up with JAM&#x27;s PVM but it is only  _tiny fraction_ of the larger addressable subset of the CoreVM service users&#x27;s 4GB virtual computer.
- So one work package might access ABC (12MB) the next might access DEF (a different 12MB), the next EFG etc, none of which exceed W\_M _individually_ but in totality across multiple work packages exceed 12MB.  In this way, you could totally want much more than 4GB.
- When a builder submits a work package to a guarantor, JAM being basically an audit protocol of what happens in up to a W\_M (12MB sized) sliver of memory of what the larger 4GB computer did.  JAM is optimized for trustless OS services.

In previous decades there was a story of &quot;640K ought to be enough for anybody&quot; and maybe &quot;I think there is a world market for about five computers&quot; -- these days 4-8B people all have 4-8GB phones in their pocket and so perhaps the trustless supercomputing equivalent is &quot;12MB/4GB ought to be enough for everyone&quot; and &quot;there is a world market for about 5 trustless supercomputers&quot; =).  Could we imagine that all 4-8B people collectively get their Shared World Computer in a 64-bit way so they may all coreplay together, even though any individual work package only references a tiny sliver? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Just to give a bit more context on why I was confused:

I hadn’t realized that the condition on
<code>𝑑𝑖=2</code> was actually implying that the **storage**, **preimages**, etc. for that account had to be _already empty_ — meaning the account must have gone through a <code>forget(Omega_F)</code> and <code>write(Omega_W)</code> before being eligible for deletion.

Initially, I thought we were supposed to manually remove these fields by directly deleting down from the partial trie key like
<code>𝐶(𝑠,𝐸4(2^32−1))</code>
which would have worked fine for **preImageLookupP** and **storage**, but not for **preImageLookupL** (because of <code>E(l)</code>) — and that one had me pulling my hair out 😅

<pre><code class=''>This encoding converts an unsigned integer into a sequence of bytes using just as many bytes as needed. Here’s how it works in simple terms:
	1.	Zero Handling:
If the integer is 0, it simply outputs one byte with the value 0.
	2.	Determining Byte Count:
For nonzero numbers, the encoder figures out how many extra bytes are needed by finding the smallest number l (from 0 to 7) such that the value fits within 7 \times (l+1) bits. If none of these work, it defaults to using 8 bytes in total.
	3.	Control Byte Creation:
The first byte (control byte) combines a prefix that indicates how many extra bytes follow and part of the number itself. The prefix is calculated as:
\text{prefix} = 256 - (1 \ll (8 - l))
The control byte is then formed by adding this prefix to the most significant bits of the number.
	4.	Appending Remaining Bytes:
After the control byte, the remaining bytes (if any) represent the lower parts of the number, each taking an 8-bit chunk.

In summary, the format starts with a control byte that tells you how many additional bytes there are and includes part of the data, followed by the extra bytes that complete the full representation of the integer.

<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-30 08:21</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#db4dca'>celadari</span>: Hi everyone,

I have a question regarding the <em>program metadata introduced in GP</em> 6.3.

If an extrinsic <code>E_P</code> includes a <code>pre_image</code> that do not conform to the expected encoding
<code>Epsilon(double_arrow Epsilon(a_m), a_c)</code>
(as specified here: <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/68eaa1f/106c01107101?v=0.6.4):" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/68eaa1f/106c01107101?v=0.6.4):</a>


Should we:
- <em>Consider the entire block invalid ?</em>
OR
- *Accept the block*, and allow the service lookup dictionaries to include these entries, with the understanding that invocations of <code>Psi_A, Psi_R, Psi_I, Psi_T</code> for the service of this pre_image would simply fail (by failing I mean that invocations panic thus don&#x27;t change state) ?
 <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-30 11:55</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: does not conform to the expected encoding of what? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-30 11:55</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: The preimage is determined solely by data encoded as per the GP specification. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-30 11:56</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Either it is requested or it is not. If it is not, then the block is invalid. There’s no room for guesswork here. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-30 14:12</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#db4dca'>celadari</span>: Let me use an example to explain my question more clearly:

Suppose we receive an incoming block with some extrinsics, among which are <code>E_P</code> extrinsics (preimages). Let’s assume one of these preimages is for service <code>s</code> and is encoded as a <code>vertical-double-array p</code>. From the first byte, we determine the length of <code>p</code>, extract the corresponding bytes, and treat that as the preimage.

This preimage <code>p</code> is expected to represent an <code>Epsilon(double_arrow Epsilon(a_m), a_c)</code> structure (<a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/68eaa1f/106c01107101?v=0.6.4)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/68eaa1f/106c01107101?v=0.6.4).</a>

Now, say <code>p = [129, 2, 4, 5, 6]</code>. Interpreting this:

The metadata slice is supposed to be of length 129, starting right after the first byte.

But the total array doesn&#x27;t even contain 129 elements—so this is clearly an incorrectly encoded preimage.

My question is:
- Should we **reject the entire block** due to this malformed preimage? 
OR
- Should we **accept the block**, include the &quot;bad formed&quot; preimage in the lookup for service <code>s</code>, and simply let the <code>Psi_A</code> panic at execution time (and thus not updating anything) for this service <code>s</code> ?</div>

Pretty sure the answer to this is no: as long as a preimage has been requested then it can be included in a block. If a service requests a preimage that cannot be decoded or used as a code blob for whatever reason, then attempts to use it as such will fail at the point of use. I&#x27;m not sure it can really work any other way as there is no type/format/whatever associated with preimages in the state; they are opaque binary blobs.</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-31 15:40</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: There are some quite similar concepts in systems theory.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-31 15:55</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: AI answer:
&gt; One relevant concept is &quot;complexity theory,&quot; which posits that as systems grow in size and complexity, the potential for disorder and misalignment among components increases. This can lead to difficulties in achieving coherence. Larger systems may have more diverse elements, which can result in varying goals, behaviors, and interactions that can disrupt overall coherence.
&gt; Another related idea is &quot;Ashby&#x27;s Law of Requisite Variety,&quot; which states that for a system to effectively manage its environment, it must be as diverse as the environment it operates in. In larger systems, the variety of components and interactions can lead to challenges in maintaining coherence unless there are effective mechanisms for integration and coordination.

<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-01 11:41</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: the speed of light determines the upper limit of causal resolution - no system could ever process causal interactions faster than this. but it doesn&#x27;t account for keeping a complex and arbitrary system in coherence. as coherent systems become bigger and more complex, the speed of their overall causality diverges from this universal physical limit. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-01 11:45</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: at a basic level, as a coherent system grows, even if all of its internal causality happened at the speed of light, it would still take longer to step through its state transitions becuase it would take light longer to get from the corners of the system to interact and resolve.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-01 11:46</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: so the system - in terms of state transitions per second - would be slower.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-01 11:47</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: this is compounded by complexity, meaning that internal causal entanglements probably resolve slower as the system grows more complex and arbitrary.</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-01 11:48</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: of course our systems have a long way to go before the speed of light becomes too important. but still, the principle can serve us well now.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-01 11:58</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: basically <code>T=ZX/C</code> where:

- <code>T</code> is time to causal resolution (s - this is the inverse of the system&#x27;s operating speed),
- <code>Z</code> is size of the system (m - the diameter of the system&#x27;s bounding sphere),
- <code>X</code> is complexity factor of the system (no units, but a factor of at least 1 which describes the number of times light must travel back across the diameter of the bounding sphere in order to guarantee a causal resolution of state-transition)
- <code>C</code> is speed of light <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-01 12:06</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: a totally trivial system would be a single laser switch in a vacuum with one light emitter transmitting a light signal to some light receiver. in this case Z would be the distance between the emitter and receiver, X would be close to one and T would therefore amount to the time it took light to travel between them.</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-01 12:07</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: as we introduce the capability of data processing <code>X</code> increases since the round trip of light is much higher as it passes through more gates and it routed around; and as we introduce state (whether intra-transition or inter-transition) <code>Z</code> increases as we need to cover a greater space to hold more information (also a fundamental physical principle as well as intuitively correct). <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

I have a question regarding the available work-reports 

The **W** available work-reports (defined in equation <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/68eaa1f/144601144601?v=0.6.4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(11.16)</a>) are extracted from <code>rhoDagger</code> using the core index. As I understand it, each core should correspond to only one work-report, is that correct?

However, I’m a bit confused about equation <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/68eaa1f/195601195601?v=0.6.4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(13.10)</a>. It sums the work-reports for a specific core from the set of available work-reports. Does this imply that the same core might appear multiple times in the available work-reports?

Please feel free to let me know if I’ve misunderstood anything.

<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-15 15:13</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#bc5896'>greywolve</span>: I think some variant of this question has been asked but I didn&#x27;t see a clear answer.

Assuming I want to submit a ticket extrinsic that will be included in the first block of a new epoch. At that point I have the last state of the previous epoch.

1. Do I use eta\_1 from the old state for the ring signature context? Given this will become eta\_2 in the next epoch when the ticket will be verified.
2. What about the y\_z, I only have access to the old y\_z. I don&#x27;t see a way to compute the new one yet. Do I just sign with the old y\_z (and y_k) and hope it doesn&#x27;t change?
3. When importing this first block in the epoch, would I use the prior y\_z or new y\_z to verify tickets? <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/68eaa1f/0f59000f5900?v=0.6.4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6.29 seems to indicate the prior.</a> <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-16 07:52</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: 1. Yes.
2. I think this is a typo (@davide - wdyt?) - it should read γ&#x27;z, not γz. I&#x27;ll change this.
3. You&#x27;ll need to compute it - you have all the information necessary from the prior state. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-17 16:04</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4977cf'>danicuki</span>: I have a doubt about core statistics formula:

<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-18 15:30</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: Can&#x27;t give you a 100% answer at this point, but it is possible. In general the plan for the final gas cost model is to charge gas only at the beginning of the basic blocks (because charging per instruction is very inefficient), so now if you allow entry points anywhere this potentially complicates the gas metering implementation. Unfortunately disallowing them doesn&#x27;t necessarily alleviate the problem because you still need to allow entry after page faults, and since memory accesses are so common we don&#x27;t want to make memory access instructions into basic block terminators.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-18 15:35</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#825bc4'>jay_ztc</span>: Thanks for clarifying, this is really helpful. I don&#x27;t have enough context yet to form an opinion on the tradeoffs between allowing inner-instances being able to resume right after pageFault vs requiring them to restart/rollback to the start of a basic block. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-18 15:37</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: Although we <em>need</em> some limitation when it comes to entry points, because without any restrictions you could e.g. jump into the middle of an instruction, and depending on the particular bytes used that might actually be a valid instruction. Supporting this in practice would be a nightmare in any other implementation that isn&#x27;t a naive slow interpreter, so at very least jumping in the middle of instructions is something that we definitely do <em>not</em> want to support.</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-18 15:42</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#825bc4'>jay_ztc</span>: But at the least, the outer pvm could do gas check to determine if it wants to &#x27;risk&#x27; another inner invocation right?

1. If c\[0\] isn&#x27;t a valid opcode, this would result in a panic, _if and only if_ the program attempts to execute c\[0\], correct?
2. If an instruction (this time corresponding to an index from the bitmask, k) contains an invalid opcode, this would result in a panic, _if and only if_ the program attempts to execute it, correct?
3. if the skip length function doesn&#x27;t find any bitmask-marked opcodes within the subsequent 24 octets, this bumps the pc to current+24. So if there happened to be a valid opcode &amp; args at that new pc, it would continue executing at the new pc in the same manner as if it were marked by the instruction bitmask, correct?

<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-22 13:00</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: Yes, currently &quot;invalid&quot; instructions don&#x27;t make the program invalid, and only have an effect if executed (they&#x27;re effectively treated as a trap). Yes, if there&#x27;s no <code>1</code> found in the bitmask then the skip is assumed to be 24. Note that IIRC currently even if the next instruction has <code>0</code> in its opcode bitmask bit (i.e. the next bit after the last bit that the bitmask scan checks) the instruction will also be executed, but this is not intended behavior and is on my TODO list to add to the GP that every instruction must have a <code>1</code> in the bitmask to be considered valid (otherwise we&#x27;ll run into some nasty corner cases). <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-22 13:08</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: Also, while we&#x27;re at the topic parsing, (this is going to be relevant to people aiming for M3 and M4) in case you&#x27;re wondering why the limit is 24 - it was deliberately picked to allow for fast parsing. To parse a PVM instruction at a given position you need to read only two values from memory: a 128-bit integer from the instructions slice, and a 32-bit integer from the bitmask slice, and then you can easily parse it in an efficient manner with bitshifts etc. (for the bitmask one can use the &quot;leading zeros&quot; intrinsic/method which is a single assembly instruction on modern CPUs to cheaply get the skip to get to the next instruction, hence the maximum is 24)</div>

Memory allocation/deallocation handling is still a work-in-progress, and it&#x27;s possible the sbrk instruction will get modified and/or removed. I&#x27;d suggest you temporarily skip it and focus on other parts of JAM and/or PVM.

If you&#x27;re interested in some history as to why sbrk is there then let me give you some background.

Historically I designed PolkaVM (on which PVM in the GP is based on) to be a VM which is as &quot;powerful&quot; as WASM VMs (so it can completely replace our current WASM-based executor in Polkadot 1.0 and our WASM-based smart contracts VM) while being as simple as possible to implement, and without sacrificing any performance.
So this is where the idea for the sbrk came from (which is similar to what WASM has): the VM maintains a heap pointer, and the guest program can use sbrk to query that pointer and/or to bump it up. And every time it crosses a page boundary the VM allocates new memory for the program.

So this design has numerous benefits. First, it&#x27;s very simple to use as a guest program (pseudo code):

<pre><code class=''>// Get a pointer to the new allocation.
let pointer = sbrk(0);
// Actually allocate it.
if sbrk(size) != 0 {
    // Allocation succeeded.
    // Now `pointer` points to `size` bytes you can use.
}
</code></pre>

This is also great for use cases like e.g. tiny smart contracts which can use this as directly as an allocator without having to bring a heavyweight allocator of their own (which would consume a lot of space).

Secondly, it&#x27;s simple to implement in the VM, something like that (pseudo code again):

<pre><code class=''>fn sbrk(size) -&gt; Pointer {
    if size == 0 {
        // The guest wants to know the current heap pointer.
        return current_heap_pointer;
    }

    // The guest wants to allocate.
    let new_heap_pointer = current_heap_pointer + size;
    if new_heap_pointer &gt; max_heap_pointer {
        // Allocation failed.
        return 0;
    }


    let next_page_boundary = align_to_page_size(current_heap_pointer);
    if new_heap_pointer &gt; next_page_boundary {
        allocate_new_pages(next_page_boundary..align_to_page_size(new_heap_pointer));
    }

    current_heap_pointer += size;
    return current_heap_pointer;
</code></pre>

And this (along with the memory map I came up with, which is what we now call &quot;standard program initialization&quot;) also makes in very easy to write an interpreter for this, because when handling loads/stores from memory you only have to do something like this:

<pre><code class=''>fn load_value32(address) -&gt; value {
    if address &gt;= stack_address &amp;&amp; address + 4 &lt;= stack_address_end {
        return stack[address - stack_address];
    } else if address &gt;= rw_data_address &amp;&amp; address + 4 &lt;= align_to_page_size(current_heap_pointer) {
        return rw_data[address - stack_address];
    } else if address &gt;= ro_data_address &amp;&amp; address + 4 &lt;= ro_data_address_end {
        return ro_data[address - stack_address];
    } else {
        // Address is inaccessible.
        return Err;
    }
}
</code></pre>

It&#x27;s cheap, fast, and doesn&#x27;t require any crazy data structures and doesn&#x27;t require any handling of corner cases (for example, accesses which could read both from the stack and from RW data don&#x27;t have to be handled, because they&#x27;re impossible by definition; the interpreter can just keep them in separate arrays, and call it a day).

So that&#x27;s how (any why) it was originally designed, but then came JAM and changed things. (: (Again, remember, I started working on this before JAM, and some things were just grandfathered into JAM.)

What JAM introduces is a concept of inner VMs (see machine, peek, poke, invoke and expunge host functions in section B.8 of the GP) where one VM can spawn another VM, and as it is currently designed those inner VMs are extremely flexible and have completely free-form memories and are dynamically paged.
What this essentially means is that all of those nice properties of sbrk that I&#x27;ve listed - simple and easy to implement, fast, doesn&#x27;t require fancy data structures - they all now go out of the window!

So we will probably be replacing sbrk with something else that&#x27;s more appropriate for the more flexible inner VM model. And unfortunately also most likely orders of magnitude harder to implement (at least if you want to reach at least the half-speed milestone), but it is what it is. I&#x27;m still finishing some other stuff up, but I&#x27;ll most likely be working on this soon-ish. (If any of you have any good and/or crazy ideas feel free to message me!) <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

1. Should these be sent out every slot even if the bitfield didn’t change from the previous distribution?
2. For an assurer to say a core is available in their assurance bitfield, does that mean they have access to just the shards matching their validator index, or are they saying they have access to ALL shards for a given core? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-23 19:02</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: 1. Yes, its critical that they are since assurances are anchored to the immediate parent header hash. The only exception is if the entire bitfield is zero, in which case I don&#x27;t believe there is a point to submitting an assurance unless some reward exists for liveness when all cores are idle (which would be sad ... but possible!)
2. Just their shards matching their validator index.  If they had access to ALL the shards, that would be too much in the large!  But of course they can do whatever they want, and they might be one of the guarantors. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

When Service A sends an amount X to Service B, a deferred transfer (i.e. <code>s: A, d: B, a: X, m: ..., g: ...</code>) is created and the amount to be sent <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/68eaa1f/325702325b02?v=0.6.4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is substracted</a> from the Service&#x27;s A balance.

But I cannot find in the GP where it says to update the balance of the receiver (service B).

I thought that it was done when <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/68eaa1f/17a00417a004?v=0.6.4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all the deferred effects of the transfers are applied</a>, but the <code>on_transfer</code> functions only modify the subject&#x27;s account storage. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
