<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-02 19:50</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#2fbc2e'>purpletentacle</span>: A couple of quick questions:

- Are there any conformance tests already public? (as per rule 15)

- is FFI for external libs acceptable (e.g. crypto from a rust lib) or while libs are acceptable, they need to be native to the chosen language?

this was written in the w3f page but does not seem to be part of the rules: 
&gt; Third-party libraries for cryptographic primitives (erasure-coding, Bandersnatch, Ed25519), codecs (e.g. SCALE), and networking (e.g. QUIC) are acceptable.

</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-02 20:38</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: FFI is fine. </div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-04 05:59</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: The protocol does rely on high quality connections (400 Mbps sustained) between validators; if you’re running a validator node then you’d need to provide this level of connectivity. </div>

@gav It would be nice if networking is ipv6 based.. this would simplify a lot the networking, nat, etc.. given that the spec will require at least 400Mbps.. most providers will be able to support ipv6 without complaining much...</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-16 12:57</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#39bc2a'>ltfschoen</span>: it says here <a href="https://jam.web3.foundation/rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://jam.web3.foundation/rules</a> that &quot;Clean-room implementation using the Graypaper and public implementor chat channels as the only resources.&quot;.

it is my understanding that the Graypaper chat channel is <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#graypaper:polkadot.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://matrix.to/#/#graypaper:polkadot.io</a>

where are the &quot;public implementer&quot; chat channels?

and is there a reason why it doesn&#x27;t include the Jam chat channel here <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#jam:polkadot.io?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://matrix.to/#/#jam:polkadot.io?</a>

also, it says &quot;Each team is only allowed to work on one implementation&quot;, but in the application form it says &quot;What programming language(s) are you using and which language set are you applying for? e.g. &quot;Rust, set B&quot;, so i don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s asking us &quot;What programming language(s) are you using&quot;. is it just wanting to know if we&#x27;ll be using multiple languages in the our single implementation (e.g. if we&#x27;ll be doing an implementation in Rust and using FFI from Ruby and Python then we&#x27;d answer <code>Rust, Ruby, Python, set B</code>?

i was actually going to try and work on multiple implementations using multiple language sets (e.g. Rust, Swift Ruby, Python, JS/TS) in parallel as a contingency incase i got stuck and couldn&#x27;t get support with one of them. after submission of our initial application form, will be possible for us to later on change what programming language(s) and language set that we&#x27;ll be using for the one implementation that could be eligible for the JAM prize?</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-16 20:09</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: For rule 7, &quot;Any JAM-implementation code which is viewed before or during implementation must be declared&quot;, is the following acceptable for declaration:

<pre><code class=''>In our implementation, beyond the Graypaper, we relied on the following for either FFIs or our learning of JAM:
 1. Koute&#x27;s PVM Implementation: (no FFI)
    https://github.com/koute/polkavm
 2. Ring VRF: (FFI [link](...))
    https://github.com/w3f/ring-vrf
 3. Sassafras (no FFI)
    https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/1336/
    https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/26
 4. Polkadot-SDK: Grandpa (no FFI)
    https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/...
 5. Polkadot-SDK: Erasure Coding (FFI [link](...))
    https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/...
</code></pre>

Are all of (1)-(5) declarations actually necessary?  Do any of (1)-(5) break &quot;clean room&quot; expectations in some way?

If the FFI vs non-FFI boundary is made clear and what should NOT be peeked at (even for learning purposes), it will spare implementers some grief (implementing something where FFI is acceptable or preferred, peeking at something which should not be peeked at).  Can you make clear which components would ideally NOT use FFI and would ideally use FFIs?  <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Closest thing I can find is the RFC, but i have a team working on a substrate solochain that&#x27;s more-or-less what&#x27;s being described in the greypaper; would love to find some more info</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-21 09:57</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: The Graypaper covers all of the main protocol elements. There’s a notable lack of spec for a full networking protocol, which doesn’t make much sense to do until the first team gets basic block importing working (Milestone 1).  <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Would the various milestones be listed in the RFP, and would that be the best place to look if somone wanted to get involved in building/helping out with the project in general?</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-06-22 04:12</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Yes, the milestones will be effectively fixed as we have information for the conformance and performance tests required for them. Since this is a protocol-oriented approach rather than software-oriented, we don&#x27;t yet have an implementation from which a reasonably tranche of test vectors can be produced.</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-21 17:59</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#7fc52e'>sergei_astapov</span>: Hey everyone,

Three passionate PBA 5 alumni have chosen to build a JAM client using Scala 3 (vanilla Scala). If you&#x27;re familiar with Scala and interested, feel free to DM me without hesitation!

Thanks!</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-22 04:16</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Mostly from scratch; Substrate specifically won&#x27;t be helpful. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-22 04:16</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Substrate is a relatively opinionated blockchain framework. It is also software, not a protocol. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-22 04:16</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Jam is a protocol. That essentially precludes it from being based on Substrate, which is software.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-22 04:19</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Grandpa is also protocol-first, so pre-existing implementations can likely be leveraged provided they are compatible with the Grandpa spec paper and the (yet to be formalised) GP-integration spec.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-22 04:24</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: For the full payout, we&#x27;ll almost certainly require a clean-room implementation of Grandpa though. Basing all node impls on a single Grandpa impl could compromise the network in case a bug were found in it.

In general, the only exceptions we can make to this rule are where the logic is extremely well-specified and understood outside of the Jam/Polkadot community, audited, and/or in heavier or more economically significant use outside of Polkadot. For this reason we can make exceptions for some of the underlying crypto/networking/math primitives which are not especially specific to Jam/Polkadot, such as EC, Ed25519, BLS, QUIC, Bandersnatch. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-22 04:28</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: As I mention above though, implementing Grandpa should not be considered an especially high-priority job. At present the definition of milestone 2 would include it, but this might very well change to milestone 3 in due course.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-22 04:58</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#48d03d'>tomusdrw</span>: &gt; &lt;@gav:polkadot.io&gt; - to disincentivize the submission of additional Milestone 1/2 submissions over developing an impl towards Milestones 3-5.
&gt; - to avoid getting multiple implementations with the same overall architecture and design (and bugs).

Given the objective of the &quot;one team = one implementation&quot; rule is to have teams focus on milestones 3-5 is it allowed to change the implementation language at some point?

I&#x27;m thinking specifically about a situation, where say, the first two milestones are completed in a less performant language (e.g. lang set C) and then the team realises there is almost no way of completing 3-5 and switch to something faster.
Obviously the prize for Milestones 1-2 wouldn&#x27;t be claimed twice, the second implementation would only claim 3-5.

Would that be acceptable?</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-22 05:00</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Totally.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-22 05:01</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: I&#x27;d also leave open the degree to which M1 and M2 could be claimable for the second language.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-22 05:03</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: If the two languages are different to the point that one could reasonably claim that it would be difficult for bugs and design flaws to cross the linguistic divide (e.g. functional vs procedural), then the Fellows (or failing that, W3F) could reasonably decide to award some or all of the prize anyway. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-22 05:04</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Ultimately, the point of the prize is to build resilience through decentralisation and diversity. The rules are (hopefully) relatively conservative in preventing loopholes which might allow teams to claim the prize without contributing to the network&#x27;s resilience. But where that conservatism might be judged by the Fellowship to be counter-productive, then it might reasonably choose to award prizes regardless. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-22 05:07</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Obviously if a team implements in C and then &quot;reimplements&quot; in a C-dominated &quot;C++&quot;, then this would not be claimable.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-22 05:08</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: But if they implement in Haskell and implement again in a very idiomatic C++, both _might_ be claimable.

<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-22 05:13</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Languages from different language sets and which do not share syntactic DNA would be a sensible lower-bar (required but not sufficient) for multiple prizes. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

The biggest risk I see, is that performance requirements are not very clear.. and very likely Rust will set the bar for every other language...

<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-22 21:17</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4cbfa8'>xlchen</span>: the bottleneck is most likely to be pvm and for production performance we most likely need to translate it to native code and run it. in that case, the language will only impact the translation phase, which should be a relatively simple thing</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-22 21:17</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4cbfa8'>xlchen</span>: so the implementation language shouldn’t matter too much</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-22 21:20</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4cbfa8'>xlchen</span>: but of course we can’t say for sure without an implementation </div>

&gt; having some guidelines on what performance (%) is acceptable below the top implementation would be useful

M5 should be a pretty easy milestone to achieve after M4 for any well-engineered codebase, so that helps mitigate against bias towards &quot;reimplementing what you know&quot;. In fact, roughly half of the actual logic is in M1 and roughly the other half in M2. M3, M4 and M5 are essentially &quot;just&quot; optimisations and security, so teams who repeatedly reimplemented M1 would probably be losing out. But point taken, and this is why the rules are as they are and it cannot be taken for granted that the same milestones by the same people will receive multiple rewards.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-23 03:06</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: &gt; having some guidelines on what performance (%) is acceptable below the top implementation would be useful

One quite likely possibility is that likely performance requirements will be set at the lower of 80% of the most performant implementation and the third-most performant implementation. It will almost certainly need to be relative to the performance of the actual implementations. Another possibility would be to be just 90% of the 3rd most performant impl. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-23 03:11</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Indeed, performance bottlenecks will almost certainly be database (which is designed to be held entirely in-memory anyway), PVM (designed for recompilation) and crypto/EC (designed to allow SIMD and aggregation, and for which FFI/external libraries are acceptable). Actual on-chain business logic is pretty minimal. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-23 03:17</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: It would be up to the team to figure out how to make the performance criteria happen. For example, a JVM-based language would probably have to do the same trick as native-built language and recompile PVM to native machine language and execute natively somehow, rather than doing the naive, fully-compatible thing and recompiling into JVM.</div>

But a full node is not trivial to run - every 6-second block is projected to have ~3.5 seconds of PVM computing in it plus a large amount of signature verification and memory access for the DB. The blocks are big: maybe 17 MB every 6 seconds. For work package building nodes I’m not sure they’d necessarily want to be running a full node.  <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

&gt; 14. Timestamps may be by virtue of pushing code to GitHub on a timely basis.

&gt; 15. For code developed in private, commit hashes should be placed, in a timely fashion, on a major public blockchain and readily visible on a block explorer.

Just to avoid any kind of future misunderstanding about this.

IF the project is done in GitHub, the requirement for pushing hashes into a blockchain is not necessary? Or for that to be fine, the github project needs to be made public and posted here? 
Or actually to be on the safe side, every project is expected to publish commit hashes to a blockchain every N days? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

If JAM is a CPU bound system, probably C, C++ or Rust could give me the best performance
If JAM is a I/O bound system, a language with more concurrent capabilities would be better. 

Which one would be the case?

My understanding of this property is that parts of the system (i.e. *services*) that need to talk a lot with one another should be close to one another to do so without needing to deal with asynchrony. The most ideal system would then be one in which services can talk synchronously to the services that happen to execute in the same core in that time-slot, and asynchronous with those that are not.  

That being said, I believe I heard in the Singapore Graypaper lecture that the interfaces for services to communicate with one another is always asynchronous. 

If correct, we can then say that services, as the lowest level programming primitive of JAM don&#x27;t enable synchronous comparability yet, but synchronous composability as described in a semi-coherent system can be built on top of them. 

This is primarily possible because of the core-model, the possibility of flexible scheduling of services in cores, and the PVM&#x27;s ability to be readily paused and resumed. One example of such system is CorePlay. 

Is that a correct description of where JAM service stand in terms of synchronous composability between one another? </div>

Basically yes. The fact that the cores are stateless and that there&#x27;s a mostly-coherent shared data lake and a fully-coherent reactor state means that there&#x27;s no structural decoherence in the same way as with persistently sharded systems like the Polkadot Relay and the present direction of Eth2.</div>

I think it makes sense to separate concerns correctly.
Otherwise, we will end up almost having something like integration tests... where the only test vector for M1 ends up being a complete block..

Moreover, some of us already implemented the JSON decoder.. because that&#x27;s the way it was delivered ! ;)
Anyway, this is not a big deal at the moment.. but it would be good to have some stability on the test vectors anyway to avoid too much rework

Having said that... I would prefer if we can keep the JSON ones.. add some for encoding/decoding.. and later on, have complete ones for actual headers and blocks <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-06-30 18:03</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: I have been bothered by the following line of questioning for the last couple of months:

- RFC 32 set a &quot;Minimal Relay Chain&quot;  architecture for Polkadot where the functions of relay chain would be &quot;split off&quot; into new system chains: Asset Hub, People, Staking, Core Time, and so forth.  The idea was that the Relay Chain REQUIRED maximal resources for validating parachains, specifically on &quot;accumulate&quot; computations.  In particular, the relay chain should not have anything like contracts-pallets because that would compromise on &quot;accumulate&quot; scalability \[to validate parachains\].  Here is your view circa October 2023:
<a href="https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/32#discussion\_r1347502727" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/32#discussion\_r1347502727</a>
- But then you put together JAM in the last year (and, this contracts-pallet based on PVM appears to be coming together nicely!).  JAM will have as its first really big JAM Service a Parachain Validation Service (run in-core and on-chain in refine vs accumulate run in PVM byte code), validating system chains and parachains with work items in work packages, judgements, and so on.
- Then, as Polkadot Fellows follow through on RFC 32 AND the JAM Service, there will be, in the limit, nothing left for the old relay chain to do!  It leaves a black hole as baby JAM takes over.
- Question 1: Instead of leaving the relay chain with nothing left to do, why not revert RFC 32&#x27;s &quot;splitting off&quot; of the relay chain components and just leave some (or all) of it on the relay chain?
- Question 2: In particular, in addition to contracts-pallet being on Asset Hub, can we revisit the old relay chain getting contracts-pallet now that the JAM Parachain Validation Service model is clear?  What are the blockers other than the big one \[of how parachain validation will &quot;switch&quot; from Polkadot Relay Chain to the JAM Parachain Validation Service\]?
- Question 3: If you believe the above is possible, then with a functioning JAM Parachain Validation Service, then what is presently called the &quot;Polkadot relay chain&quot; could become a (well connected) parachain like all others, complete with smart contracts.  Problems like CEX integration to Asset Hub ... disappear, UX improvements to integrate disparate parachains are pushed off to another day while people figure out if some of these &quot;split off&quot; decisions from RFC 32 are better solved within a JAM Service architecture or as a parachain ... or as a smart contract on Polkadot (no longer validating anything) ... or elsewhere.  Can we revert RFC 32 now that JAM is well architected in this way?  If not, why not? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

about the test runner... would that involve defining APIs for tests? It sounds that it would introduce architectural constraints to implementations at a very early stage. I think these kind of tests should be applicable at an integration level much later..
At the moment, we just add jamvectors as a submodule in our code and treat them as external data for simple unit tests..</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-07-04 10:25</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c9419d'>davxy</span>: Well for sure having error codes as an aid of &quot;what went wrong&quot; is useful.
But I agree that it is an implementation detail and it must not go in the GP.
So IMHO a good compromise is to:

1. (As Juan suggested) define the error codes only in the ASN.1 (as a hint to the implementer of why the test fails)
2. (As Gav suggested) make more explicit that the error code field is not related to conformance. Unfortunately <code>_</code> can&#x27;t be used in standard ASN.1 LOL. But I can rename it to something like <code>application-specific-errno</code> (with a big warning that this is not specified in the GP). <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

There are decisions to be made, and they can be broken down to the combinations of type of the timing model, the type of fault tolerance and the type of agreeable failures of the message channels.

- Since I&#x27;m very good with niche functional languages, I&#x27;m considering entering the competition with Haskell, Elixir, OCaml, F# or Scala.

- There is a restriction that a team can only enter with a single language, but can one person be part of multiple teams?</div>

Lol. One person who should be no more capable of reading and assessing the GP that you or your team says casually &quot;3 to 6 months&quot; and somehow you think it&#x27;s helpful?</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-07-15 10:27</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Perhaps it might be sensible to read and understand the specification <em>you</em> want to implement (enough to make a rough estimate of how long you think it might take <em>you</em> to implement, anyway) before considering the case closed.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-07-15 10:28</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: I&#x27;ll put it another way: if you cannot get far enough through the paper to understand how much effort it might take you or your team to implement, perhaps that&#x27;s not a great sign for things to come? Basing your predictions not on the specification of what you&#x27;d have to implement or you/your team&#x27;s skills, talents and background but rather on the casual opinion of a single self-selected member of the public seems like an extraordinarily ill-considered approach. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-07-15 10:34</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#a8a636'>darkartistry</span>: That was what was on my mind.

<div class='msg'><time>2024-07-15 10:56</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Perhaps one point which could be clearer is the purpose of the JAM-prize: the W3F is not handing $60m+ out specifically in order to get lots of redundant code into the ecosystem. The reason for such a large prize fund is to help create a lot of experts on the protocol. Experts who understand, *inside-out*, both the strict protocol _and_ the numerous factors in creating a viable implementation. The prizes denominated in DOT, Fellowship membership and other long-term benefits and support are all there to help incentivise those experts to stick around for the long-haul whether to continue improving their implementations, to help evolve the protocol or to build atop of it. In pursuit of this, we&#x27;ll take a rather sink-or-swim tactic with teams: beyond corrections and clarifications to the GP, we&#x27;ll be offering no great help along the way and will expect teams to solve their own problems in their own way. It&#x27;s not the fastest way of getting from A to B, but this forges a rare asset: the kind of expertise you get from innovators learning through first-principles. Furthermore, it also helps ensure an intellectually diverse ecosystem less constrained by the biases and design-decisions of a single engineering team, leading to a more resilient engineering ecosystem. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

I am not sure how we could objectively know who are &quot;serious implementors&quot; for travel reimbursement, perhaps there is some &quot;Block Importer&quot; test that could be objectively or subjectively applied?

I&#x27;ll build a headcount model for teams on #1024 by July 30 so we know if we&#x27;re over budget, but I think if we have 40 people we &quot;fix&quot; it in Dec/Jan.  We do need serious people and probably we&#x27;ll learn the rough boundary between serious and non-serious together at November&#x27;s Devcon.  Passing all available test vectors or being clear about whatever the bottlenecks are for each team is my idea of &quot;serious&quot;.  Hopefully the spirit of getting each other unstuck and having fun while honoring &quot;clean room&quot; rules can be satisfied.   <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

&quot;A: Cooperation between teams is essential but anything which goes beyond trivial misunderstandings of the graypaper should be documented, either as issues in the GP repo or as side notes of the implementation to be submitted at the time of milestone review. To stay safe, teams should stay away from the implementation specifics of other implementations and definitely not be sharing code.
It&#x27;s ok to ruminate on high level approaches to solve problems or optimize, it&#x27;s not so ok to be looking at some other implementation&#x27;s specific solution.
What the Fellowship will be looking out for is for undeclared collusion between teams. Code which appears to be a little too similar for it to have been independently written. A big red flag would be the same bug popping up in two implementations.
But this is not to detract from the fun of getting two cleanroom impls talking to each other. Of course this is a big part of it and you mustn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s not allowed.
Just be sure to document anything which you discover when working alongside another team so everyone can benefit.&quot;</div>

I think such a bounty would be too generous. W3F have had bad experiences with client-development SLAs in the past. One good element of the prize is to help weed out the mercenaries from the missionaries; we would not especially want to attract those who would refuse to take a risk on Polkadot and its development timeline: indeed we would active want to have people who have skin-in-the-game in this regard. </div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-07-28 19:05</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: Both this child bounty approach and the JAM prize are driven by the same basic bounty criteria, except with unfinalized networking added (bar raised) and accepting an unratified evolving GP spec (bar lowered).     There is no &quot;service agreement&quot; implied after the JAM prize nor after any child bounty to continue to support the implementation, but you can certainly expect to see the entities receiving the child bounties to continue into the JAM prize because its literally 3x higher.  You could add a rule to ensure that  any payments from OpenGov could be subtracted.  Seems fairer to me to add now rather than at the end.   But what makes the &quot;SLA&quot; label appropriate?

I gather the underlying &quot;SLA&quot; expectation is that if you receive 500K DOT after having spent 2 years building something for a prize that doesn&#x27;t have any SLA after it, the team will endeavor to spend many more years after as if there was an SLA.  Is that it? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-07-29 02:32</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: If mercenaries are valued at $0, this is about the cost to get a JAM protocol missionary.

I conjecture that the 500K DOT bounty gets AT MINIMUM 3 missionaries + 3 mercenaries completing M3 by Q2 2025, where 4 of them get compensated.  If you believe that 100% of teams with a Fellow are missionary teams, then there are 3 missionary teams already.

I actually conjecture that it is far more likely that there are 5 missionaries and 2 mercenaries that get compensated with this bounty, all of whom continue on to earn some JAM Prize.  The cost to get a JAM protocol missionary: 100K DOT (500K/5 missionaries).

With the JAM Prize alone, I conjecture you get 10 missionaries and 10 mercenaries.  The cost to get each missionary, if all 10MM DOT are actually exhausted, is 1MM DOT/missionary.

With both in place, you get 5 more missionaries.  The cost is 10.5MM DOT/10 = 1.05MM DOT/missionary.  If you deduct any OpenGov received amounts from Prize winnings, its less than that.  So the additional cost is just the number of mercenaries funded by the bounty.  Do we have a mercenary detector mechanism to minimize this cost?

If you think you get 20 missionaries and 0 mercenaries, you&#x27;ll be at 500K DOT/missionary with the JAM prize alone.  For a cost conscious missionary buyer, where does that leave the generosity?

I see so little difference between paying 1MM DOT/missionary vs 1.05MM DOT/missionary that the &quot;generosity&quot; is pretty clearly on the JAM Prize side.  5% is noise of the week.   I&#x27;m happy as a lark to see so many teams implementing this month, now I just want to see acceleration because the ideas are all done.

This price of accelerating JAM execution, the 4th generation blockchain architecture, is probably the absolute best use of OpenGov resources I know of.

You can suggest curator requirements (e.g there must be at least 3 teams with a fellow on them) to increase the probability that we get the cost per missionary even lower than 100K DOT/missionary, but this accelerant is only intended to get JAM execution in a better state in early to mid-2025 than without it.  That&#x27;s the basic analysis. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

is all we have right now, its very new and fresh since you only posted it at the start of this month =).  I cannot guess the difference betweeen JAMSNP, JAMNP-S, or JAMNP -- - is there a difference?  Its definitely not obvious with a lot of TBDs.  If you say the networking will be the one of the last things to be finalized, we understand.    

On <em>canonical M1</em>  test vectors, is this a different set than what you referred to on June 3: &quot;Block execution vectors should be ~6 weeks out.  Availability system test vectors probably about the same timeline.&quot;  The existence of these test vectors, even in draft PR form, are highly valuable accelerants for M1/M2 well well in advance of 1.0 ratification.

But given how well described the GP is, implementers can fill in many details of block import vectors + JAM network details, some/most of which are easy to infer from the GP alone.  The more complete the test vectors are, and closer to the &quot;prize&quot; requirements, the better, but I understand pestering won&#x27;t help. We imagine honest test vectors can come from the implementers themselves as well, however not canonical.   

Some of the leading teams have fellowship talent within their ranks, and we understand its a side goal to develop fellowship talent through increased JAM protocol expertise.  Earning your rank could be done through this kind of contribution. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

I gather it is &quot;you will stick around after completing M5 and claiming the prize, and become a valued fellowship member&quot; like a missionary instead of &quot;We will leave after claiming X milestone bounty&quot; like a mercenary.  Can anyone spot the mercenaries in  <a href="https://jamcha.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://jamcha.in/</a> now without  ever having interacted with them? 

The mercenaries within the JAM implementer set are those that are just like &quot;what do we have to do to pass Milestone X and get Milestone X prize money (or bounty)&quot;.  The missionaries  want to build the whole thing, are curious as to how and why it works, and will want to improve it/attack it/...    Interviewers can often detect the difference.  Unfortunately, its hard for bounty curators, JAM Prize judges or any human to read peoples minds objectively the way you can objectively check whether some implementation does or does not pass a test vector.   Every incentive structure will have some type 1 and type 2 &quot;errors&quot;, if you can call them &quot;errors&quot;.  After all, some &quot;missionaries&quot; will have kids to feed, mortgages to pay off, parents to take care of -- and some &quot;mercenaries&quot; can become &quot;missionaries&quot; after falling in love with the protocol and proving to themselves that they are good at implementing and maintaining it.  Its easy to be black-and-white about it and pretend that this kind of real life doesn&#x27;t exist.     <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

“Serious implementers” is a silly notion period. There’s only “implementers”. It is: conformance, performance &amp; security and in that particular order. Some teams will finish first and some teams will finish later.
Any additional incentive structure distorts the objectives of Jam Implementers Prize and unlevels the playing field.
I’d suggest a new moderation rule for this channel: to disallow any talk about alternate/additional funding for JAM implementation teams (besides the Prize) in this channel.

<div class='msg'><time>2024-07-29 04:05</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4cbfa8'>xlchen</span>: I am confused about trap vs halt vs panic in PVM. In GP, the trap instruction will exit with the black square, so does the jump to <code>2^32-2^16</code> address. To my understanding that is <code>exit 0</code>. But in the pvm testvector, trap is panic and the test of the trap instruction will result trap exit status but the <code>inst_ret_halt</code> test results <code>halt</code>. There is some inconsistency.

 Agreed, &quot;serious&quot; subjective. if anyone contributes to moving the needle; it is a positive contribution and should not be discounted. Incentives is a NASH to accelerate work, but if you &quot;serious&quot; about blockchain being a movement then &quot;one&quot; would encourage participation and teamwork for democratization as the ultimate payoff.

But then these parachains will also need to share one core. Probably if you have some profitable MEV that you want to execute, it may be useful.

My comments basically encapsulates the issue opened on Polkadot here: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/811</a>

As I understand with how services are being designed in JAM, their only ability to read and write data is to the DA layer.

This is of course the preferred and most scalable method for services to place data. Services that want to store long term data are asked to have their own data shard.

However, when thinking about the kinds of services which can be built on JAM, and affording those services the most flexibility, I can imagine that services will want to be able to write to a long term storage without having to maintain their own collators or data shards. This is basically what existing smart contract platforms afford to contracts.

My high level suggestion is that JAM should also include an API where services can write data to the main JAM database, probably under the general opaque key/value store of preimages.

Then, executing the state transition function of services should be able to read from a combination of the DA and the stored preimages in the JAM database.

Writing here could be super expensive, such that we encourage good behavior to NOT use it frivolously, but to not have it at all seems like a missed scenario.

I think if JAM is going to be the most general web3 computer, it does make sense to have such an API, and can help provide a feature which can onboard more services to use JAM. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Most of the teams are asking questions.  If you find any sock puppet candidates let me know!   Note there is some People Chain/Identity issue and some kind of Polkassembly issue (or polkadot.js extension update) that prevented new people commenting without an identity, so failing to comment alone is not a robust sock puppet detector =)

I don&#x27;t want _everyone_ to be required to write a report (we will do our best as proponent) nor be present for 72 hours (12 hours x 6 days), but I will ask everyone what teams they learned from and who they taught what.  If there are any Michiko Watanabes, they would not appear on anyone&#x27;s list.  We have 100 days before the event to know each other on matrix rooms, and at least for our part on reimbursement, I&#x27;ll probably be able to remember 40 some people.   <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-08-01 18:33</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#db4dca'>celadari</span>: Hi davxy ,

I checked the chat and read your discussion with Sourabh regarding signature verification. I also checked the two repositories <code>ark-ec-vrfs</code> and <code>bandersnatch-vrfs-spec</code>

I wanted to confirm my understanding: Is <code>pub type RingCommitment&amp;lt;S&amp;gt; = ring_proof::FixedColumnsCommitted&amp;lt;BaseField&amp;lt;S&amp;gt;, PcsCommitment&amp;lt;S&amp;gt;&amp;gt;; </code>the ring root commitment ($\gamma_z$) mentioned in the Gray Paper?

If yes, when we need a verifier for the ring commitment, we need <code>PcsParams</code>. What should I use? From the code, it seems we take these params from the ring context, and there appears to be some randomness when instantiating ring context. Is this normal? Should I just initialize the ring context with <code>RingContext::from_seed(RING_DOMAIN_SIZE, [0; 32])</code> in the code and not worry about the rest ?

Thanks in advance !</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-08-02 05:56</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4cbfa8'>xlchen</span>: Any suggestions on in what order to implement the protocols? Considerations: stability of the spec, availability and stability of test vectors, coupling with other protocols (e.g. can&#x27;t do B unless A is implemented and size/complexity. e.g. First thing should be the codec, and then Safrole (which depends on the codec) is a good starting point as it is relatively simple, presumably no plan to update it in GP, and with test vectors merged (i.e. stable). and then?</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-02 06:18</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#db4dca'>celadari</span>: I don&#x27;t think you need codec to work on safrole. You just need to parse the json files to your data structures for testing. The way you parse the json shouldn&#x27;t really matter for codec no ? 🤔</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-02 06:20</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4cbfa8'>xlchen</span>: I guess I didn’t give the best example but the safrole test vector does have a encoded one which will need codec to be implemented to use</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-02 06:45</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#db4dca'>celadari</span>: What do you mean by encoded one ? I think you can evenly divide into two tests: pure safrole protocol implementation with json and later codec</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-02 07:15</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4cbfa8'>xlchen</span>: my point will be true if there isn’t any json test case provided but only scale one</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-02 10:59</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cdc232'>oliver.tale-yazdi</span>: I went by the state dependency graph. Sure there is a risk to do things wrong without test vectors, but most corrections to the GP so far were quite minor (modulo the judgement/dispute/verdict alterations).  
SCALE is still a good idea IMHO to pass all the Safrole tests.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-02 14:26</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: I think every team will be different.

For a team of 3+ all the major &quot;starting&quot; components can be done in parallel:

1. Safrole (FFI)
2. PVM
3. State DB : Tries, DA abstraction
4. Erasure coding (FFI)
5. Scale
where trying to pass the test vectors is basically educational.

Then doing this serially:
6. JAMNP for some small V with a matching RS different than 4
7. Producing blocks with 1, 3, 5, 6 coming together validating tickets,  sending tickets, authoring blocks and validating blocks, write to state trie; set up your DB
8. Wiring up (2) with tiniest refine and accumulate you can write with enough host functions to put (4) together with importing and exporting.
9. work packages with core assignments (V=6, C=2)

We are putting the bones of (6)-(9) together now, then I imagine:
10. treatment of assurances, audits, and judgements/disputes (not sure how to order these yet)
11. statistics
12. authorization, transfer, gas+storage bookkeeping
13. filling in validation TODOs for conformance
14. All remaining host functions needed for serious JAM services, including privileged

===
15. Beefy
16. GRANDPA
17. General polish: Expiring items, edge cases of PVM

Along the way we&#x27;ll get more test vectors and then polish and optimize polish and optimize.

We can stand up a &quot;tiny&quot; that doesn&#x27;t do any work, then one that does work with basic JAM services, then one that does work that is guaranteed/ assured/audited, then one that has evil actors doing increasing amounts of evil, then one that has increasing numbers of cores together, ending up in the &quot;full&quot; toaster =).

My (increasingly less wild guess) is that I see 2 man years of work for 95-99th+ percentile engineers so having a team of 4 is best to cut it down to like 6 months (your guess), but I&#x27;d guess 2 99th percentile engineers could do it all in less than 6 months.  But the sheer diversity of different types of things seem to require a bunch of different kinds of people, so I&#x27;d worry about the team of 1.

I would hate teams to not get started on this exciting journey just because 100% of all test vectors aren&#x27;t available.  They have been immensely valuable to understand all the basic components though, even if in draft form. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

We are currently putting a team of Parachain members to build a JAM Client in Rust. We are looking to comprise multiple ecosystem partners of a team around 4-6 people either part time or full time that would implement the graypaper. We would be beginning in the following weeks. We were wondering the state of play considering the stiff competition in the B category.

Our goal is to build knowledge from the existing ecosystem teams and share that expertise of the JAM Clients to build a stronger ecosystem when the JAM comes around consider it “Spreading the butter over the toast then the JAM .”

We are looking for team members in the ecosystem Rust from Parachain teams to include. KILT would be leading the team.</div>

This is one of previous Gav&#x27;s responses: &quot;Third-party libraries (FFI) for cryptographic primitives (erasure-coding, Bandersnatch, Ed25519), codecs (e.g. SCALE) and networking (e.g. QUIC) are acceptable. Everything else should be properly implemented.&quot;

We have the following extrinsic:

<pre><code class='json'>{

        &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;0x8e.......cf7&quot;
      },

      {
        &quot;attempt&quot;: 0,
        &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;0xa7....38&quot;
      },
      {
        &quot;attempt&quot;: 1,
        &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;0x52....f0&quot;

        &quot;attempt&quot;: 1,
        &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;0x16......53&quot;
      }
</code></pre>

Verifying signatures and thus getting VRF output I get in the same order:
0x3a....ad
0x5d....98
0x8b....d9
0xae....b4
0xb1.....75

but then they are not in any order (ascending or descending) if taken as LITTLE-ENDIAN.
(They are in ascending order if taken as BIG-ENDIAN though...)

**Is there a problem with the order of extrinsic in this file or there is something I am missing ?** <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

The representation of a hex string is independent of endianness (big-endian or little-endian). However, if you&#x27;re trying to define an ordering between arrays of bytes, endianness will have an impact. 

When comparing two arrays of bytes, you need to decide whether the arrays are in big-endian (BE) or little-endian (LE) format. This will determine how you compare the bytes one by one until a strict comparison is established.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-09 21:37</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4cbfa8'>xlchen</span>: yes and they are le</div>

which is the case for this proposal, but i think something in parallel to sub0, same venue, 1 day completely focused on JAM would make more sense for JAM impl devs who can attend both events easily (sub0 and Jam0), and it would reduce costs (instead of organising 2 separate events in different parts of the city, we get two events in one) - we are also experimenting with this first JAM event so something in a more controlled enviroment like Sub0 and getting support from the Sub0 organisers might make more sense. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-08-15 07:33</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Perhaps we could run a parallel event in Europe at the same time. </div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-15 07:39</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#ca815c'>rtti-5220</span>: i dont think running an event in asia and one in europe in parallel is the best idea for devs who might want to see both, which in general happens - since JAM is on the first stage of development and is the first event focused on this impl. Furthemore, it makes it more costly. </div>

I think it’s probably fine; it’d be nice to meet everyone but assuming I can’t make it we can always organise JAM1 in early 2025. The idea of engendering cross-pollination between Eth and Jam communities is a good one, and if it’s mostly about M1 interop then physical presence is a bit less important. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-08-15 07:53</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#7664c9'>emielvanderhoek</span>: The assumption I believe is that half November we’d get as far as running a M1 ‘tiny’ importer network between clients.

And I can already foresee some struggles that we are going to have due to number of components required for the whole thing to work especially many of the components are still in draft stage (e.g. networking). In simple words, this is too much for an initial MVP and there will be a good chance we won&#x27;t be able to deliver it as there are too much uncertainties. It is a good target for us to try, but I won&#x27;t bet for it.

When a task is too big, what we do is to break it down. So here is my suggestion:

Figure out a simple way for implementations to communicate. It needs to be simple, so pipes (i.e. stdout/stdin). Every program can print and shouldn&#x27;t take more than 10 line of code to allow it to read. In that way we can have many standalone binaries confirming a same interface and we can assemble all those binaries together for lot more interesting tests. For example, team A have implemented all the components and team B only implemented Safrole, team C only implemented PVM. We can replace the Safrole@TeamA to Safrole@TeamB and PVM@TeamA to PVM@TeamC and still be able to setup a multi client testnet covers some work from team B and C. This also forces everyone to write modular code, which is a good thing as well.

The &quot;pipes&quot; model standing in place of QUIC and the binary from teams being the core deliverable would be immensely valuable -- is repurposing a fraction of ZombieNet \[which works using chain binaries\] useful for this?

Its immediately clear this pipes+binaries approach is clearly a LOT easier for teams working together with as a proxy for JAMNP, automating the ip/port &quot;setup&quot;, but probably can continue into JAMNP with &quot;binaries trading&quot; with a few flags switching modes.

Having a test runner for the existing test vector set makes sense, but the PVM test vector case is quite a different character than all the others in that its almost totally removed from networking -- to use your concrete example, if &quot;team C&quot; only implemented PVM, they would only be able to run through the test runner on just the PVM, and not be able to do anything with &quot;team A&quot; and &quot;team B&quot;.  In contrast, team A+B will talk Safrole and can continue onto the other 4 extrinsics, which are .. not very modular.    Team C hasn&#x27;t gotten very far, not to pass too much judgement here, but has a LOT of catching up to do.

We do have a tiny (V=6, C=2) QUIC passing Ticket + Blocks  (with JSON serialization/deserialization instead of SCALE encoding/decoding) and are proceeding along with our own little RS code (with W\_C x W\_S \&lt;\&lt; 4104, like 24) to get the other 4 extrinsics with DA over the next 4-6 weeks, going from &quot;Team B&quot; to &quot;Team A&quot;.   We believe deviating from GP Appendix H to support a tiny RS code is essential for multi-team MVP success and hope we can &quot;pick some parameters&quot; together matched to the &quot;tiny&quot; Safrole test vectors.

We believe a battery of &quot;trivial&quot; jam work packages / services (refine+accumulate, then adding in the auth+transfer) that utilize the host functions are critical for education and enabling team As to keep going.   (In the absence of this, we are currently hand assembling our own little sum of squares battery, replacing a byte here and there for host function calls).  We imagine the first A teams that publish 4-5 epochs (48-60 blocks) covering this battery can argue between themselves about state roots, but it would be even better if we had a  authoritative &quot;M0&quot; 48-60 block dump that covered all the extrinsics, modeled DA, to make arguments tend to zero.  Then we all would just try to get M0 to work on our own first as a prereq to binary trading.

We would be happy to supply whatever binary works by early Oct and hope there are a bunch of &quot;A teams&quot; and &quot;B teams&quot; where we can do pre-work in October.   If there are any A candidates who get to pipes model before Oct, we&#x27;ll be inspired to match you, pls share! <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Our team was recently working on a PVM implementation and we&#x27;ve also built a tool that we hope will help other implementors. <a href="https://pvm.fluffylabs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://pvm.fluffylabs.dev/</a> &lt;-- here you can find our PVM Disassembler.

It can load a JSON test case file and visualise what instructions are used in the code. By plugging a PVM implementation you can also turn it into a debugger. If any of the teams is interested we want to make it possible to upload a WASM blob of your PVM implementation and run it instead of ours (see open issue on github regarding the interface). We plan to support running two PVMs in parallel and checking their state (registers / memory / gas) at every step and display the exact instruction when they start to differ.

Tool&#x27;s code is open source on github, so feel free to fork or report any issues or feature requests there. We are looking forward for your feedback.</div>

so basically this inputs: 
- so signature from <code>input.extrinsic[0].signature</code> = <code>0xb342bf8f...85a8</code>
- and ringroot commitment <code>pre_state.gamma_z</code> = <code>0x96a4b4...74cf</code>
- posterior eta_2 from <code>post_state.eta[2]</code> = <code>0xbb30..14aa</code>

according to paper i just need to concatenate <code>$jam_ticket_seal</code> with <code>posterior eta 2</code> and the attempt (<code>1</code> in the json)

this (if i understand properly) should be the input data. 

I am not able to get the code to verify the signature. I basically checked this piece of code for it
<a href="https://github.com/davxy/bandersnatch-vrfs-spec/blob/ae82b19e99cdc1301820d9cbd978e0a73b9de2a8/example/src/main.rs#L134" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/davxy/bandersnatch-vrfs-spec/blob/ae82b19e99cdc1301820d9cbd978e0a73b9de2a8/example/src/main.rs#L134</a>

and modified to have the ring context to be of size 6 and pass an empty aux_data... but <code>Public::verify().is_err()</code> is always <code>true</code> 

I am a bit lost to be honest any help would be appreciated. </div>

&gt; <a href="https://github.com/davxy/bandersnatch-vrfs-spec/blob/ae82b19e99cdc1301820d9cbd978e0a73b9de2a8/example/src/main.rs#L134" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/davxy/bandersnatch-vrfs-spec/blob/ae82b19e99cdc1301820d9cbd978e0a73b9de2a8/example/src/main.rs#L134</a>
&gt; 
&gt; and modified to have the ring context to be of size 6 and pass an empty aux_data... but <code>Public::verify().is_err()</code> is always <code>true</code> 
&gt; 
&gt; I am a bit lost to be honest any help would be appreciated.

One for davxy to look at.</div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-09-09 07:08</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: But of course most likely one might not want to implement something in another language right off the bat. Initially it&#x27;s usually simpler/more convenient to just keep everything in a single language, you don&#x27;t need to be fast for the first two milestones anyway, and also because probably the easiest way to prove that you _had_ to use another language for speed is to compare it with an implementation in your original language and show the difference.

Once we get to the point where people will reach the latter milestones and will want to optimize the performance of their implemenations then (if there&#x27;s interest) I could probably host a workshop/presentation/whatever on how to write a fast VM, to help people write more performant PVM implementations (this could be especially useful if your team doesn&#x27;t have any VM or low-level performance experts) <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-31 15:35</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: The extrinsic ED is a result of the auditing process.

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-31 15:53</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: FWIW auditing is an off-chain activity that may stretch over multiple time slots. While it is triggered by work reports becoming available, which is reported on-chain, the chain doesn&#x27;t really wait for auditing to finish as such. If, as a result of the auditing process, a block author discovers that some other validator has misbehaved, then they will include this in ED. They may also build on an older block, if accumulation of some bad work reports needs to be reverted</div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-09-03 14:23</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#5adda3'>shwchg</span>: David Emett: Hi again, I&#x27;d like to ask you some further questions.
In ELVES, an initial small group of auditors is selected to audit the block. If all members of this group vote in favor, the block is approved. However, if someone is absent or votes against, the process either enters the dispute phase or additional auditors are selected to vote until a sufficient number of approvals are obtained.

In Jam, a work report group is selected for auditing, and each validator performs this task. 
Here, does each validator select ten others to issue announcements, or is it a single validator selecting ten?
After the announcement is made, do others who receive it also perform the corresponding audit work?

I might have many questions. If it&#x27;s convenient, could you please give me a more detailed explanation? I believe there are some differences between ELVES and the audit process described in the Gray Paper, and it seems like there are many aspects in the GP that aren&#x27;t clearly explained.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-09-03 14:26</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: In each tranche, each validator makes its own decision of whether to audit the work report or not. This decision is made based on the outcome of a VRF. An announcement is made by each validator that decides it should perform an audit</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-09-03 14:27</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: As validators choose randomly whether to perform an audit or not, the number in each tranche isn&#x27;t really fixed, it&#x27;s an expected number</div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-09-03 14:54</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#5adda3'>shwchg</span>: 

I think what you said makes sense to me. So, if a validator wants to participate in the audit, they will use this function to select the initial work reports to audit and will issue announcements for these 10 work reports in tranche 0. At the same time, other validators will also be doing this.

In tranche 1, they will use this function to check if there are any missing or false judgments and then decide whether or not to join the audit for that work report.

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-09-03 15:24</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: The first tranche works a bit differently to the others. _Every_ validator will select 10 cores at random to audit, these are chosen according to the first set of equations you linked. Note that this means each report will get on average 30 validators auditing it (at most one report per core per block, 3 validators per core), but there may be more or less depending on how the randomness works out</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-09-03 15:27</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: In tranches 1 and later yes the second set of equations you linked are used.

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-09-03 15:28</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: These equations effectively evaluate each work report separately</div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-31 08:10</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: I believe the easter egg design that Gav is aiming for with JAM is:
(1) work packages with <code>refine</code> that have arbitrary length extrinsic blobs, but
(a) assurable by the MANY (2/3) \[183\] but
(b) auditable by the FEW
(2) SLIM blocks with just (hash, length) pairs sharable with ALL, validated by ALL, thus (285)

Clearly, JAM departs from the classic FAT block paradigm where all transactions/extrinsics are stored in every block (and validated by ALL), all state transitions verifiable from genesis, in favor of SLIM blocks ala (2) with as much &quot;work&quot; **and data** pushed out to cores ala (1).  (285) shows the FAT extrinsics are gone, but   the question is how audits can be done with the TINY onion of (183)+(184). <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-31 08:18</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: The contention on the work packages + work items on whether FAT extrinsics are kept &quot;alongside&quot; vs &quot;inside&quot; work packages is also to keep work packages SLIM like the blocks, by keeping FAT extrinsics out of work items _as well_, while also meeting assurance/auditability concerns and keeping the availability proof onion TINY.

Just a guess (since we have not reconstructed the onion yet) but its seems clear of the whole extrinsic by the FEW when audited is necessary.  The key bits doesn&#x27;t have to be in the block or the work package, and maybe not in the work items either so long as it makes it into the onion.

I think the bottom line is we need to get clarity on where &quot;extrinsic data&quot; represented by the symbol ${\bf x}$ are 
(a) (hash, len) pairs  
vs 
(b) arbitrary length blobs 
From [my guess of] the design considerations I believe the Work Items will use (a) but we need to know where (b) is exactly.   The &quot;alongside&quot; imply the first guarantor erasure encode (b) and then everyone else deals with (a).  Can you confirm this? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-31 10:20</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: The extrinsic data is placed into the availability system alongside the work package, so it is available to all validators. This is necessary as all validators may need to audit the work report. One possible confusion here is that &quot;extrinsic&quot; is used to describe both extrinsic block data (guarantees, assurances, disputes, etc) _and_ extrinsic work item blobs</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-31 10:29</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: The full extrinsic block data is shared amongst all validators, though only via block publication.

Which part of GP (or JAMNP) describes this &quot;The full extrinsic block data is shared amongst all validators&quot;?

I believe 
(a) ${\bf x}$ are the hashes of 
(b) $\bar{x}$ 
where (b) is erasure-encoded into &quot;Audit DA system&quot; for a few hours, and just for auditing to reduce bandwidth/storage.  

Work items/work packages only have (a).  The availability proof (eq 183) only concerns (a) but auditors can reconstruct (b) for just a few hours.  </div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-31 15:03</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: &quot;To reduce bandwidth/storage&quot; is not really accurate. The extrinsic data for a work report is made available until the report is considered audited, at which point it is no longer needed</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-31 15:04</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: The reason for erasure coding is so that the data can be retrieved by auditors even if the original guarantors refuse to present it upon request</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-31 15:04</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: In normal operation, auditors will not reconstruct via the erasure coded chunks but simply ask the guarantors for the data</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-31 15:05</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: Possibly in the initial version the just-ask-the-guarantors thing will not exist, as it&#x27;s just an optimisation</div>

Sorry I guess this is not really accurate. The reason for distributing amongst all validators is this. Erasure coding rather than eg sending the full data to each validator _is_ to save bandwidth/storage</div>

FWIW the message you replied to was talking about the block extrinsic data E, though it seems this is not actually what you&#x27;re interested in. Not sure if the GP says anywhere explicitly that this is shared, but it&#x27;s not really possible to validate blocks etc unless it is</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-08-31 16:55</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: Validation of the &quot;off-chain&quot; refine extrinsic data is done through the auditing (which re-executes the same refine after reconstruction), which is a requirement for finalization of blocks.  Validation of blocks (which is done by all validators) does not require this auditing of the <code>refine</code> execution to be done by every validator, but just a few.    The <code>accumulate</code> execution must be done by all validators to validate a block.  We need to peel all the layers of the availability specifier to maximally appreciate the beauty/novelty of this =) <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

A Work Package contains only (hash, length) pairs to define extrinsic data. Guarantors may disregard a Work Package if they have been failed to be furnished with the correct preimages (it&#x27;s up to the submitter to give them the real extrinsic data in addition to the WP).</div>

by your answer i gather that&#x27;s ok


edit:
what i mean is, if I&#x27;m not decoding them back to a point, then i understand i just filter these keys out when creating a new epoch root, but the GP does not  mention any filtering action here, 
so I&#x27;m not sure how to procceed

<div class='msg'><time>2024-09-13 11:59</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c9419d'>davxy</span>: I reviewed your comments. The reasons are design decisions, so you should eventually raise your concerns in the graypaper. In any case, IMHO, it is better to maintain a uniform design for u16/u32 encoding in the protocol rather than saving 1 byte here and there by introducing pitfalls related to variable-length encoding.</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-09-13 12:24</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#3c8ec8'>bmaas</span>: Thanks for the prompt reply davxy . I&#x27;m not suggesting saving everything in just one byte. When I study the formula—272—I expect that the length of the encoding should be derivable from the l-value. Thus in the example <code>header-0.json</code> case, <code>l</code> would be 0, and thus following the formula it would produce 0 extra octets. For this reason I was not expecting the extra 3 bytes.

I believe I found the misunderstanding, 272 , there is a note: at present utilized only in encoding the length prefix of variable-length sequences.</div>

To confirm my understanding first:

- On each epoch, every next epoch validator (<code>γk</code>) can submit to up two tickets
- Block authors are incentivized to include up to 16 tickets in extrinsic
- Potential block authors should maintain an tickets pool and include top tickets when authoring new blocks
- Tickets are not gossiped. So every next epoch validators should submit their two tickets to every current epoch validators.
- Next epoch validators shouldn&#x27;t need to resubmit their tickets or it could be counted as spam?
- So current validators should persist the pending tickets pool across restarts
- In order to make it possible for the first block of an epoch to include full 16 tickets, next next epoch validators (<code>ι</code>) should start generating and submit tickets before they become <code>γk</code>. The ring commitment will depends on <code>ψo</code> but it is unlikely for it to change at and of an epoch as we are not expecting punishments in more than 99.9% of the time.
- So validators should be expected to receive tickets for both current and next ring commitment

And my questions:
As JAMSNP currently defined, ticket submission seems like is only for 1 ticket only? But validator are almost always want to send two tickets. So better to make it to expect two tickets
What exactly does the success / bad mean? Ack the data is received or expecting the receiver to validate the data? i.e. verify it is a valid ticket and not a duplicated etc. I will image it will be just ack but need to confirm.
What is the expected optimal behaviour of ticket submission? Every next next epoch validators (<code>ι</code>)  submit tickets at and of an epoch and resubmits at start of an epoch in case the expected ring commitment changed?
So validators are expected to receive tickets for two different epoch. In that case, should the ticket submission protocol to include an epoch index to keep things simpler? Otherwise the receiver may need to verify the tickets twice to figure out if it is valid or not. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-09-20 08:26</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: I&#x27;ve got some pending changes to JAMSNP. For Safrole ticket submission I currently have this...

### CE 128/129: Safrole ticket submission

Sharing of a Safrole ticket for inclusion in a block.

Safrole tickets are distributed in the epoch prior to the one in which they are to be used. They
are distributed in two steps. Each ticket is first sent from the generating validator to a
deterministically-selected &quot;proxy&quot; validator. This proxy validator then sends the ticket to _all_
current validators.

The first step should be performed shortly after the connectivity changes for a new epoch are
applied. The index of the proxy validator for a ticket is determined by interpreting the last 4
bytes of the ticket&#x27;s VRF output as a big-endian unsigned integer, modulo the number of validators
minus 1. The proxy validator is selected from the next epoch&#x27;s validator list, excluding the
generating validator.

Proxy validators should verify the signature of any ticket they receive, and verify that they are
the correct proxy for the ticket. If these checks succeed, they should forward the ticket to all
current validators. Forwarding should be delayed until a fixed point in the epoch (eg 3 minutes
in), to avoid exposing the timing of the initial message. Forwarding should be spaced out over the
first half of the Safrole lottery period. Forwarding may be stopped if the ticket is included in a
block.

Protocol 128 is used for the first step (generating validator to proxy validator), protocol 129 is
used for the second step (proxy validator to all current validators).

<pre><code class=''>Attempt = { 0, 1 }
Ticket = Attempt ++ Signature

&gt; validator are almost always want to send two tickets. So better to make it to expect two tickets

Might be changed in the full protocol but for simplicity we decided to stick with a single ticket for JAMSNP.

&gt; What exactly does the success / bad mean? Ack the data is received or expecting the receiver to validate the data? i.e. verify it is a valid ticket and not a duplicated etc. I will image it will be just ack but need to confirm.

I&#x27;ve taken out success/bad. Failure should be indicated by resetting/stopping the stream. I think
for Safrole you can finish (= succeed) as soon as you have received the data, ie just ack.

&gt; What is the expected optimal behaviour of ticket submission? Every next next epoch validators (ι)
&gt; submit tickets at and of an epoch and resubmits at start of an epoch in case the expected ring
&gt; commitment changed?

I think this is described now.

&gt; So validators are expected to receive tickets for two different epoch. In that case, should the
&gt; ticket submission protocol to include an epoch index to keep things simpler? Otherwise the
&gt; receiver may need to verify the tickets twice to figure out if it is valid or not.

Validators should only expect tickets for the next epoch.

No. I currently have this defined as follows...

### Epoch transitions

At the beginning of a new epoch, validators should wait to apply connectivity changes until both:

- The first block in the epoch has been finalized.
- At least 2 minutes have elapsed since the beginning of the epoch.

This rule is intended to synchronize connectivity changes across validators, making epoch
transitions smoother.

<div class='msg'><time>2024-09-23 22:11</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#db4dca'>celadari</span>: Regarding ticket submission for Safrole, would it make sense to adopt an onion routing approach? Not for initial release but for latter. Each ticket could be sent through 3 different routes, with 3 proxies per route. The message would be encrypted for each proxy along the way, and only the final proxy decrypts the ticket without knowing the original sender.

We can deterministically choose the routes using VRF output for different inputs and require a ring root signature for validation.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-09-23 22:11</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#db4dca'>celadari</span>: Regarding the last part to be a bit more specific:</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-09-23 22:49</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: This is indeed the plan. Perhaps davxy wants to comment further.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-09-24 09:59</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c9419d'>davxy</span>: The idea has been considered and maybe, in some variant, will become part of the final protocol for ticket submission. Initially, however, the protocol described by David Emett  (JAMSNP CE 128/129) will be adopted, where the ticket is submitted via a proxy whose identity is pseudo-randomly determined by the ticket ID. This means that anyone can infer the proxy responsible for a given ticket T (i.e., the proxy is f(T) and he knows who is the ticket creator).

In the upcoming weeks, various possibilities will certainly be discussed. However, it is important to understand whether the existence of this &quot;public&quot; actor (aka proxy) who knows the identity of the ticket author is required, for instance, to efficiently submit information directly to the next block author directly via the proxy. Honestly this point is not 100% clear to me yet.

If the presence of a public proxy to the ticket author is indeed required, the relevance of onion routing becomes a bit less relevant. Although it may still useful for some other aspects, such make traffic analysis more complicated. Proxy can still exist even with onion routing, e.g. by disclosing ticket&#x27;s author identity only to the exit node and reusing the idea of CE 128 for deterministic proxy in function of T.

I would be happy to hear more ideas in this area, indeed!</div>

- Safrole vectors have also been updated in content. The ring-proof backend introduced some internal changes which invalidate the old signatures (and tickets). If you are using <code>ark-ec-vrfs</code>, please update to the latest revision, as ticket verification will fail otherwise.

I think you need to update gamma_s accordingly after end ticket submission as soon as possible: best is before new epoch but if as you said the whole end phase is skipped then you do it before &quot;taking in&quot; the new block you receive

Say current time t = 60, timeslot = 10, for block author of timeslot 11, when should it start producing block? what time is the deadline? say we provide 2s for block production (what is the max time allowed for block production?), then the block author should start producing block at t = 66 and sending blocks at t = 68? other validators should receive block by t = 70 and have it confirmed before t = 72?

How about guaranteeing? For guarantors of cores at timeslot 11, what time should it start producing work report and what&#x27;s the deadline of sending it out? Does it need to make sure the work report is available at t = 66 so the block author can accumulate it in block #11? So it should start the work at t = 60?</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-10-07 06:57</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: A block of time slot t = 10 becomes valid once the clock reads 60. On this basis, an optimal block author for t=10 will have sent the block to arrive at all other validator nodes by then. Validators should then have distributed all relevant extrinsic information for this block to arrive in time for the author to include it in a block and then send the necessary block information back to them (we’re working on merklising the extrinsic commitment so that not the whole block needs to be distributed if the receiver has the various extrinsic components). We’re still working on having specific timing guidelines as this will be affected by practical matters ; indeed ideal timing probably won’t be properly fixed until we have the toaster running.  <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Guaranteeing is fairly flexible as a block author can include reports from both the current and previous core rotations. I expect guarantor timing will be mostly down to builders as, unless guarantors are already busy with previous packages, there seems little point in waiting to refine a package. As Gav says though I don&#x27;t think we will have a good idea of when things should be scheduled until we have a test network running, so I would just make sure any values are easy to change.</div>

To facilitate this, I&#x27;ve also built a Whitespace assembler/interpreter/debugger, which helped me work on it. It’s released under the MIT license here: <a href="https://github.com/voliva/wsa." target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/voliva/wsa.</a> Additionally, I&#x27;ve developed a memory layout convention and a &quot;standard library&quot; to make it a bit more practical.

I thought I&#x27;d share this in case someone finds it interesting. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be building JAM (probably not even the first milestone) in Whitespace, as I really don&#x27;t have time for it, but I find it fun to solve small objectives in esoteric languages like these.</div>

  - e.g. like Substrate, the RPC provide metadata and raw data and it is up to the SDK to decode the data

  - or make it more complicated but dev friendly by returning typed data directly (e.g. JSON)</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-10-08 05:01</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4cbfa8'>xlchen</span>: I think we will go for JSONRPC + HTTP. i.e. something similar to Substrate for the reasons:

- Target users are only JAM devs and network operators. Note: dapp devs, service providers (e.g. CEX), wallets are NOT target users. They should not deal with JAM chain directly. Therefore most of the downsides of the existing Substrate JSONRPC doesn&#x27;t apply (e.g. requires heavy SDK to decode data returned from JSONRPC). Block explorer / Indexer may have some interests on fetching JAM chain data but it is still only for devs only. No user should worry about JAM chain data.
- Most if not all JAM devs will already be familiar with JSONRPC.
- JSONRPC with WebSocket supports pushing, which is a very useful feature. RESTful is out of option then. We could do RESTful + WebSocket but then it will be extra work for benefits not super relevant. This RPC does not need to be easy to use.
- JSONRPC is not efficient. But under the context of JAM chain, that&#x27;s something we can deal with. We may want to have some HTTP methods for methods that needs to return large binary payload to avoid the overhead of hex encode / decode the binary data.

JSONRPC + Websocket sounds good to me, i would integrate this into our node if it existed. About metadata: for most of them we probably dont need it, only if we want to have extensions or something later that should be forward-compatible with future clients. I think for the beginning maybe not needed?</div>

I get your point. What I&#x27;m arguing about is:
1. Why wrap binary data into JSON if we can just return binary data directly.
2. Why introduce another layer of API methods if we have JAMSNP already that should cover the case of getting and even announcing required raw data from the node.
3. Why integrate HTTP/WS server into the node if this can be a middleware that&#x27;s shared between all implementations.

So my idea would be to:
1. define a low-level IPC/mmap socket that can speak JAMSNP (or some subset of it) (every implementation)
2. have a &quot;RPC app&quot; connect to that socket and expose JSONRPC or whatever more human/browser friendly protocol to display the data (shared between implementations)</div>

Either this or have the nodes create this IPC/memory-mapped file endpoint that can be used. You don&#x27;t need QUIC for that, pure in-out, new-line delimited, etc.</div>

Ah, that&#x27;s true. That could either be done in the shared middleware or if there is something that could be used out of the box to just translate the transport then yes, that would be in the app.
We do have the codec ready and we happen to write in TypeScript - I&#x27;m happy to publish it separately to npm.js It wasn&#x27;t my intention to plug our solutions stuff here, so sorry about that.</div>

&gt; 
&gt; - Which RPC protocol?
&gt;   - JSONRPC
&gt;   - gRPC
&gt;   - Restful
&gt;   - something else?
&gt; - How high level should the RPC be?
&gt;   - e.g. like Substrate, the RPC provide metadata and raw data and it is up to the SDK to decode the data
&gt;     - we don&#x27;t need metadata here as the types are all spec&#x27;ed in GP
&gt;   - or make it more complicated but dev friendly by returning typed data directly (e.g. JSON)

If you could map these terms into GP symbols that probably will help

Bundle Shard, 
[Segment Shard], 
Justification = [Hash OR (Hash ++ Hash)]

We are pretty sure we know the first 2 having implemented it and drawn our own diagrams... but are not sure whats going on with the OR 😅 and having confirmations that map onto our various diagrams will help us and everyone else attack this head on 😀

Some quick+easy questions:

1. You don&#x27;t use JAM Codec  except the &quot;As in GP&quot; cases (UP 0 - Header, CE 128 - Block, CE 133 - Work Package, CE 134-Work Package Bundle, CE 135+136 - Work Report) -- so teams who pass the codec test (which cover all of these except &quot;Work Package Bundle&quot;) have little-to no &quot;extra&quot; codec work to do since everything else is just byte-level work.  Can you confirm this?
2. What is the type of <code>len</code> in the <code>len++</code> prefixes?   Is it u32/... or is it following JAM codec (being the only other exception to (1))?
3. Why is CE 136 needed if the block contains the work report within a guarantee, contained within a block?  See <a href="https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/blob/master/codec/data/guarantees\_extrinsic.json#L3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/blob/master/codec/data/guarantees\_extrinsic.json#L3</a>
4. What should happen where some object (Block, Work Report, Bundle Shard, Audit Shard, Segment Shard, Preimage) is &quot;not found&quot;?
5. Since most teams haven&#x27;t gotten to auditing+GRANDPA implementations yet, is the expected behavior of handshake to dump of headers from genesis (the only finalized states) to the tip?
6. Many of us grew up with easily shared &quot;curl&quot; for JSON-RPC calls -- what do you recommend as an equivalent tool for QUIC testing?  Specifically, for CE 133, is there some way to have an easy to use builder package submission that eliminates any need to have JSON-RPC <code>jam_submitWorkPackage</code> methods?
7. Is feedback like &quot;It might be nice to have Work Report at the end for CE 135&quot; useful?
8. You didn&#x27;t have &quot;Ticket&quot; as one of the &quot;As in GP&quot; cases because you felt the need to split out &quot;Epoch&quot; in there.  Would you agree that the JAM-codec encoded Ticket should have &quot;Epoch&quot; so &quot;CE 131/132&quot; could have &quot;Ticket&quot; transmission be &quot;As in GP&quot;?

Can you confirm this?

Not sure that&#x27;s true. Sequences and integers are encoded as per the JAM codec (&quot;Encoding is as per the serialization codec defined in the gray paper&quot;). The things where I&#x27;ve said &quot;As in GP&quot; are simply entire structures that are already well-defined in the GP.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-14 17:32</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: &gt; What is the type of len in the len++ prefixes? Is it u32/... or is it following JAM codec (being the only other exception to (1))?

As in the JAM codec; <code>len++</code> is the same as the up/down arrow symbol in the GP. Maybe there is a unicode character for that symbol that I can use instead.</div>

That&#x27;s currently how blocks are defined in the GP, but Gav had tentatively agreed to change blocks to only contain work-report hashes, to improve distribution efficiency (work-reports should be distributed to all validators via CE 135, so also distributing them as part of blocks is quite wasteful). Either this change will get made in the GP or the SNP will need updating.</div>

Simply stop/reset the stream: &quot;Unless otherwise specified, resetting/stopping of a CE stream by the stream initiator should be considered cancellation of the request, and resetting/stopping of a stream by the stream acceptor should be considered rejection of the request or failure to process the request&quot;. QUIC allows an error-code to be passed when stopping/resetting a stream; currently, I&#x27;ve not defined error codes, but it may prove useful to define some in the future.</div>

We&#x27;ve implemented a dummy finalizer which simply finalizes blocks which have at least 5 descendants. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll specify this anywhere but something like this should do until Grandpa is in place.

I think I didn&#x27;t say &quot;as in GP&quot; in this case because the definition of a ticket is so simple. The epoch index isn&#x27;t really required, as it&#x27;s implied by the time at which the ticket is sent/received, but I figured it was sensible to include it anyway as a sanity check.

Alright we did the same &quot;dummy finalizer&quot; and since we&#x27;re closing in on Recent Blocks/C3=Beta we can attack Section 18 &quot;Beefy Distribution&quot;.  Is there going to be some on chain aggregation of BLS Signatures every epoch or something like that?  If so, don&#x27;t we need a CE for individual sigs to be gossiped around.   If not, where do these go?

When it&#x27;s an error, the binary encodes 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, or 0x04. When it&#x27;s not, it encodes 0x00 [len encoding] [bytesequence].

<div class='msg'><time>2024-10-17 19:56</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#dbc767'>stanleyli</span>: Hi David Emett (also davxy), sorry I still have questions about work package and work package bundle:

(1) For the import_segments sitting inside of work_item. what&#x27;s the definition of tree_root &amp; index in import_segments? Is the tree_root here referring to certain work report&#x27;s exported_segment_root and exported_segment_idx, which will include justification going up erasure_root(u), or is this are the exported_segment_root with justification going up to expoerted_segment_root(e)?

<a href="https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/blob/master/codec/data/work_package.json#L22-L62" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/blob/master/codec/data/work_package.json#L22-L62</a>
{
  &quot;tree_root&quot;: &quot;0x461236a7eb29dcffc1dd282ce1de0e0ed691fc80e91e02276fe8f778f088a1b8&quot;,
  &quot;index&quot;: 0
}

(2) When looking at published codec data, I can see both work package have workItem containing importedSegment always starting from index 0 ... up to 3 with no gap. Is it a coincidence, or index here actually mean the index within a workItem?

(3) In CE134, you mentioned &quot;All import segments have been retrieved...&quot; and &quot;a full work-package bundle is sent, along with any necessary work-package hash to segment root mappings&quot;. [Work Package Hash ++ Segment Root] how does this allow other guarantor to validate anything? Also what does the original Guarantor have to do to get the exportedSegment, by doing CE 139?

(4) Is there a work_package_bundle data available so we can make sure we got the format correct conforming to 14.1.1 in GP 0.4.2 and your jam_np?</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-17 20:55</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: &gt; Is the tree_root here referring to certain work report&#x27;s exported_segment_root and exported_segment_idx

Yes.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-17 20:58</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: &gt; which will include justification going up erasure\_root(u), or is this are the exported\_segment\_root with justification going up to expoerted\_segment\_root(e)

Not sure I understand what you&#x27;re asking here. Individual segment shards can be proven up to the erasure root. Reconstructed segments can be proven up to the segment root. These proofs of segments up to the segment root are packed into proof pages and erasure coded alongside the segments. When you fetch the shards for a segment and reconstruct it, you will also need to fetch the shards for the relevant proof segment and reconstruct it in order to be able to (a) confirm that the segment was reconstructed correctly and (b) prove this to auditors <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

This sounds like a coincidence to me, but I am not really familiar with the released test vectors.</div>

The other guarantor can check the work-package in the same way the original guarantor checked it when receiving it from the builder. It doesn&#x27;t need to fetch the import segments though, as the work-package bundle should contain these plus proofs of them; the logic for verifying the import segments can be the same as for auditors.

If you mean how should the WPH-&gt;SR mapping be checked, then the answer can simply be by constructing a mapping in the same way the original guarantor did and seeing if it matches. The point of sending this mapping is just to avoid wasting time in the case where the guarantors don&#x27;t agree on a mapping. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

That makes sense.

But for the regular (H,i) case, which I think it&#x27;s the hash is the segmentroot of a single segment itself? In this case, how can guarantor recover the segment as using this segmentRoot alone if builder only provide the guarantor single segmentRoot?

I think the more difficult case is recovering  exported segments using its own segement root and I don&#x27;t know how guarantor can get such mapping</div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-17 23:00</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#dbc767'>stanleyli</span>: Originally I thought having &quot;constant/stable&quot; identifier -- where correctness of the segment can be verified by doing H(recovered\_data) in pvm (similar to how work\_pacake\_hash can be used  identify workpackage\_byte or codeHash -&gt; codeBlob  would be straight forward). But I understand your concerns of having to memorize 2k hash. 

In our implementation, we decided to provide segmentRoot for each segment\_shard to enable direct segment fetch. This endup being quite wasteful since the shard is only 12 bytes. We will remove it and follow your design. 

Our remaining question is the size of pageproof: <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/293bf5a/1a4f001a5100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/293bf5a/1a4f001a5100</a>

 Is the ↕s here the actual segment or the segmentHash? If it&#x27;s segment, then each element within the pageproof (encode as 6Hash + G) will make this pageproof super large (up to 64G).

Can you predict the size of pageproof? I think you might be saying that pageProof will not include the segment itself?  which is different than what I see in eq 196

<div class='msg'><time>2024-10-18 11:53</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: We already have an early revision of this internally (just used for tests at present) and will tidy up and publish in due course. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-10-18 12:27</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: We have single-team testnet  and can definitely have multi-team testnets after getting this genesis state containing the bootstrap service.  Definitely ready.

We have our &quot;tiny&quot; V=6/C=2 testnet with CE133/134/135 (work package submission/sharing =&gt; work report distribution) with 1 core being assured now via CE141 and hitting accumulate entry points, updated with the new JAMSNP details.   We currently have &quot;hard coded&quot; a <code>fib</code> test service into state trie (via the service&#x27;s preimage) -- we can totally improve this to have a genesis state with this &quot;bootstrap&quot; assign service (with a <code>new</code> host call) instead of our current &quot;hard coded&quot; situation.

Ok -- so my questions concerning privileged / always accumulate services (which are not GP but JAMSNP related, but its blurry here):

1. if a user sends their Work Package into the bootstrap assign service via CE133 containing their service code blob, presumably to any validator on any core (since the assign service does not belong to a core ... or does it?), what happens next?
2. In JAMSNP,  CE134 has the first guarantor sharing with 2 others, resulting in a work report distribution -- should it share with all V-1 instead if its known to be among the 3 privileged  or always-accumulate  services in <code>\chi_g</code>?
3. Does a work report need to be distributed at all then via CE 135 for the privileged / always accumulate service?
4. Can CE 141 be skipped then?  

We will take the answers to this and accommodate in our revisiting &quot;Accumulate&quot; (to cover ordered accumulation since we finally have real assurances in our testnet), covering both the normal work packages and the above &quot;always-accumulate&quot;.  We can publish our genesis state and believe many other teams can use the same genesis state + publish exact same answers to get single-team testnets and then proceed to multi-team testnets now. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

We&#x27;re writing our &quot;Create New Service&quot; service (for this bootstrap service) with code/code length coming through payload ${\\bf y}$, in a very byte-y way and find ourselves wishing for ABIs for calls &quot;createService(uint32 code\_length, \[\]byte code)&quot; and something like event logs like &quot;ServiceCreated(uint32 service\_id)&quot;.

Some other bootstrap design could have used extrinsics ${\\bf x}$ to do the same basic function, another might use imported segments to  exported segments, or have multiple methods (to cover changing the validator keysets) to cover all 3 functions.   Is there some convention services should use to publish their invocation for the 4 entry points?

What is the role of JAM Codec for the key input and outputs { y, x, i, e, o, ...  } in such a convention?

&gt; 
&gt; (1) For the import_segments sitting inside of work_item. what&#x27;s the definition of tree_root &amp; index in import_segments? Is the tree_root here referring to certain work report&#x27;s exported_segment_root and exported_segment_idx, which will include justification going up erasure_root(u), or is this are the exported_segment_root with justification going up to expoerted_segment_root(e)?

&gt;   &quot;index&quot;: 0
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; (2) When looking at published codec data, I can see both work package have workItem containing importedSegment always starting from index 0 ... up to 3 with no gap. Is it a coincidence, or index here actually mean the index within a workItem?
&gt; 
&gt; (3) In CE134, you mentioned &quot;All import segments have been retrieved...&quot; and &quot;a full work-package bundle is sent, along with any necessary work-package hash to segment root mappings&quot;. [Work Package Hash ++ Segment Root] how does this allow other guarantor to validate anything? Also what does the original Guarantor have to do to get the exportedSegment, by doing CE 139?
&gt; 
&gt; (4) Is there a work_package_bundle data available so we can make sure we got the format correct conforming to 14.1.1 in GP 0.4.2 and your jam_np?

The content of the **codec** test vectors is not supposed to be significant. These vectors are only used to test your codec encode/decode functions

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-21 17:38</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: Regarding JAM’s primary role being a roll-up host, is the intention for it to be exclusively used for Polkadot parachains/rollups built with the Polkadot SDK/Substrate, or extend to support non-Polkadot &quot;foreign&quot; rollups?

You suggest the foreign possibility in GP: “Smart-contract state may be held in a coherent format on the Jam chain, as long as any updates are made through the 15kb/core/sec work results, which would only need to contain the hashes of the altered contracts’ state roots.”     Would it be worthwhile to build shims between smart contract platforms like OP Stack, ArbOS, etc., to leverage JAM DA+Work packages, or would this be a futile effort given the native capabilities of Polkadot SDK/Substrate-built chains, extending to revive+PVM?

A Rollup host that can have &quot;semi-coherent&quot; messaging between different kinds of rollup platforms would be very awesome.  Is there some spam-resistant DMP-like process out of accumulate/transfer or HRMP-like messaging service that could support both native and foreign rollups ... if foreign rollups belong in JAM?

Not sure about this, but from your suggestion, I assume you mean being able to prove the next state root of an optimistic rollup (e.g. OP Stack, ArbOS)  with a JAM work package containing JUST the hashes of the altered contracts’ state roots, correct?    But what about { Account balances/Nonces, Contract storage, Contract code, remaining unaltered state }, which also affect the state root?  You must have some key simplification/insight to make it fit within JAM, maybe coupled with a particular enabling technology.   

The lazy/stay-optimistic approach would be to have another rollup (Asset Hub or whatever else with revive) represent ETH L1 and get the messaging service in place.  Making optimistic rollups into &quot;cynical/pessimistic&quot; rollups for foreign rollup platforms would be groundbreaking but needs these simplifications/insights.   Can you share your insights on how Polkadot ecosystem can break ground with foreign rollups in this way? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Production would be different. Most likely it will be the parachains service which is given all three privileges. The Staking/CoreTime chains would be able to set validators, assign cores, request blobs and create services. </div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-10-23 04:24</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#d87741'>lucas</span>: I am intersted in chatting with Gossemer team members. 

I am also interested in networking with other JAM engineers. 

I saw that a solo JAM implementation may also be desired, &amp; beneficial. 

I am also wondering if  there are any set vcs practices that aren&#x27;t mentioned anywhere on the relevant web resources? Is there any universal agreement among teams with VCS or other engineering practices? What happens if I am engineering solo, parts of my implementation are copied by another team &amp; put in their implementation? How would anyone know if it was originally my implementation vs theirs or vice versa?  

Wondering as well if anyone is working on JAM related projects that aren&#x27;t specifically implementations? 

I am also wondering if I build for example a dApp or something similar on top of a new JAM client implementation if that is more desired than for example an improved JAM client implementation by itself even if the client may perform better by focusing only on that &amp; not building on top of it?   

For example, I think it&#x27;d be cool to build a decentralised gaming server, that could also be a good experiment to test decentralised network performance &amp; benchmark it against non decentralised server clusters. 

Some questions that can be explored for example, are all server clusters a form of decentralisation if some resources are distributed or only if they are distributed in a certain way? 

What defines a decentralised http or protocol request? 

I haven&#x27;t discovered any universal answers for the above, or agreement related to them. 

Is there a stack exchange or similar forum, where it is better to ask these questions? </div>

1. Yes, there is a 10 million DOT pot available for implementations of JAM. Many different teams are already working on it <a href="https://jam.web3.foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://jam.web3.foundation/</a>
2. As Bryan said, teams that copy/paste from others are disqualified. You can timestamp your code in a variety of ways, e.g., making a system.remark of the latest commit hash at regular intervals. I recommend reading through the rules here: <a href="https://jam.web3.foundation/rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://jam.web3.foundation/rules</a>

The bits and pieces I have:
- Last day at sub0 (11 Nov) will focus on JAM
- JAM0 scheduled on 12-16 Nov. But treasury proposal got rejected. Is this still happening? If yes is there a rough idea of objectives?

Where can I find the latest info and keep updated? 🙏🏻</div>

Anything you want to do will create Schelling points for all of us schedule-wise.  What would you like to see?</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-24 04:47</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: I&#x27;ll be there 9th and 10th, and I&#x27;m fairly flexible over how the time is used.</div>

I myself would be  most keen to get your concrete ideas on how to properly design/develop a JAM Service for ETH L2 optimistic rollups.  Here is my first attempt at a write up:

 <a href="https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/127" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/127</a>

We can find you at the end of the 10th, but if we should study something beforehand to gain some competence in how to approach this better, we will do that.  If we&#x27;re on the right track, we can take a stab at reducing it to practice, or course correct based on your advice right now.  </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-10-23 13:49</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: sub0 is 9th through the 11th -- You should register for a free ticket <a href="https://sub0.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://sub0.gg/</a> and look for JAM related content on the schedule, which is under prep there.    127 Na Ranong Rd. , Khlong Toei, Bangkok is the address.  rektormoon can speak to other details not on the site but... Hackerspace is open to all implementers 24h!

JAM0 is a mostly open ended hackathon type arrangement with 2-3x/day &quot;sessions&quot; where we cover whatever topics anyone wants for 30-90 mins (e.g at 10:30am and 2pm and 5pm) as a group and any team can network with any other team \[always following official/unofficial rules\].   We have a big room that can hold everyone for up to 80 people on the 11th,12th,15th,16th so we can do whatever we want.  On the 13th and 14th we have a smaller room that can hold up to 30.  For 11th-16th both rooms are available 9am-9pm.  I&#x27;m collecting a headcount here so we can buy everyone a lunch or dinner if there is quorum of people:

<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1\_Ar0CWH8cDq\_mAoVkqZ20fXjfNQQ9ziv1jsVJBAfd1c/edit?gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1\_Ar0CWH8cDq\_mAoVkqZ20fXjfNQQ9ziv1jsVJBAfd1c/edit?gid=0#gid=0</a>

You can add your topics \[I put 2\] but no prep is required.  If you are a JAM implementer (and have ever asked a JAM-related GP question to qualify you), I&#x27;ll put you in a JAM0 room so you can find everyone else.  We are happy to sponsor the venue + food but have no travel budget.  If you have any questions/wishes, you can DM me @sourabhniyogi and we&#x27;ll do our best to be a good host.  Address is 95,370 Sukhumvit Soi 24, Khwaeng Klongton, Khet Klongtoey

Devcon 7 is Nov 12th-15th and a 25 min walk from both places.  Tickets are sold out but there is a waitlist.  I&#x27;m not seeing a schedule but everyone is welcome to go back and forth between the JAM0 rooms at Valia and Devcon 7 all through 4 days from 9am-9pm. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-10-23 14:29</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: &gt; &lt;@dave:parity.io&gt; I&#x27;ve uploaded a more fleshed out definition of the &quot;simple&quot; network protocol for JAM here: <a href="https://github.com/zdave-parity/jam-np/blob/main/simple.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/zdave-parity/jam-np/blob/main/simple.md</a>

FYI I&#x27;ve pushed a fix to CE 142. Previously, only the hash of the preimage was sent, which isn&#x27;t really enough to check whether the preimage has been requested on chain or not. Now the ID of the requesting service and the length of the preimage are also sent.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-23 19:28</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c377dd'>mkchung</span>: Can you clarify who is &quot;non-validator&quot; node in your CE 142, and whether CE 142 is primarily designed for covering the &quot;solicit=13&quot; case?

Is the &quot;non-validator&quot; a node outside of V=1023? I initially thought this &quot;non-validator&quot; could be the wp &quot;builder&quot; submitting a wp that ultimately triggers the &quot;new=9&quot; or &quot;solicit=13&quot; at the accumulation stage. If that were the case, it would make sense that the builder wouldn&#x27;t know which service account is being created, thus only allowing the <code>preimageHash</code> to be announced. It would also make sense that builder would want to get its preimage into on-chain state, thus it will resume preimage announcement responsibility.

However, if CE 142 is also intended to cover the &quot;new=9&quot; case, then the &quot;non-validator&quot; cannot be just the builder -- as the <code>service_id</code> must go through the check-and-bump logic <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/439ca37/2b5c012b5c01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. (I interpret builder as core user who only cares about using it, but not actually running it)

If non-validator != builder, how does non-validator know the <code>service_id</code> and <code>preimageData</code> in general, especially when a new service is being created? If non-validator implies that the announcement responsibility is from someone outside of <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/439ca37/183400183700" target="_blank" rel="noopener">active validator set</a>, then what&#x27;s the incentive or penalty to make sure requested preimages are being answered promptly?</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-23 21:58</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: &quot;Non-validator node&quot; was just to clarify that you should allow these announcements from essentially any node. You probably don&#x27;t need to prevent validator nodes from using this protocol, but a normal validator node would have no reason to use it, as these announcements are not intended to be gossiped.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-23 22:17</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: CE 142 is intended for both the solicit case and the new case. In the new case, the party providing the preimage will need to learn what the new service ID is by following the chain somehow. How exactly this is done is not prescribed as there is no need for everyone to do it in the same way.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-23 22:17</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: &gt; then what&#x27;s the incentive or penalty to make sure requested preimages are being answered promptly?

This is a concern of the service requesting the preimages, not a concern of JAM. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-23 22:24</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: That is to say, if you write a service which requests some preimage, you should have a plan for who is responsible for providing the actual preimage. Maybe your service allows people to pay to create smart contracts, in which case the creator of a contract will have an incentive to upload the contract code.</div>

Let me know what you think I got wrong?  Or if you have a bootstrap assembly that does it better/right, maybe that is ready for sharing?  I understand there are problems that are useful as exercises for the reader, and this is a great one, but perhaps achieving consensus on this is worth it. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-23 19:11</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: ?  We believe the <code>Service ID</code> was necessary in your fix, but don&#x27;t see why <code>Preimage Length</code> was needed as well.  What is the reason for its inclusion in CE142?</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-23 22:31</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: The dictionary **l** in each service has keys of type (Hash, Preimage Length). You will want to look into this dictionary to determine if a preimage has been requested or not. Without the preimage length it&#x27;s not easy to do this (not strictly speaking impossible of course) <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

The &quot;CKB VM&quot; is also a RISC-V VM (and it&#x27;s arguably even more RISC-V than PolkaVM/PVM, because it uses completely vanilla RISC-V) and yet it&#x27;s, well, not that great if you look at the benchmarks. :P</div>

to make non-Polkadot ORUs validated in JAM. 

We would like to implement a Eth light client to do what Snowfork does and apply it usefully but don&#x27;t see how it helps the non-Polkadot ORUs get validity.  It can only help non-Polkadot ZKRUs achieve finality more quickly, but its non-Polkadot ORUs that need their challenge window to disappear. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-10-28 15:56</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: With non-Polkadot ORUs you don&#x27;t win much of anything with verification of storage proofs against state root at B and storage proofs against the child of B.  For an ORU, the best we can really do is ensure blocks are available in DA, which is fine, but not the giant win -- you still need fraud proofs and a challenge window.  Or, I missed some critical insight of what you mean here

Did you mean for this to apply to ETH L2 ORU?

For useful JAM Services for non-Polkadot rollups its these:
(1) Basic DA for non-Polkadot RUs (ORU or ZKRU) 
(2) ETH Light Client Service
(3) Grandfatherable ZKRU, using (2)
but not
(4) Grandfatherable ORU, except for (1) <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Yes non-sensible versus &quot;sensible&quot; in today&#x27;s world may be more when versus if. ;) Games relying on rational actors is a concern. Bravo on using/funding multi programming languages. That is Nobel prize level stuff towards unstoppable ;) For direct multi-objective incentive mechanisms to counter non-rational actors, could the JAM framework consider incorporating game-theoretic approaches that weigh reputational and non-financial factors? In my humble view and experience NASH is not absolute with state actors when stoppable is a goal..</div>

I’ve broken the blob into pieces, and then those pieces into the octet pairs. The pairs were then converted to 16 bits. I’m now trying to figure out the field element formula. It looks to be the summation of each bit multiplied by “vj” and this is where I’m not sure what value to use. If j = 7, then vj = α14 +α4 +α. What is α here? </div>

I followed Rob H&#x27;s feedback on &quot;pursue all forks&quot; instead of Jeff&#x27;s for now (as well as the intuition of all the other Polkadot heavyweights, see #127) -- basically geth&#x27;s Consensus API [recently added by karalabe in Sept] gets the state witnesses and it can feed into revm -- all good with JAM refine.  I am not sure how much work it will be to put revm through polkatool, but I am now optimistic we can do this.  

In addition to general feedback, do you have a better choice of Rust EVM interpreter than revm such that we can more easily achieve the goal of interpret EVM in PolkaVM?    <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-11-05 15:02</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: &gt; &lt;@xlchen:matrix.org&gt; <a href="https://github.com/zdave-parity/jam-np/blob/main/simple.md#ce-129-state-request" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/zdave-parity/jam-np/blob/main/simple.md#ce-129-state-request</a>
&gt; I don&#x27;t really understand about the boundary node part. can we have some examples? also examples for each message request/response will be super helpful

As an example, say the trie looks like this:

           a
       b       c
     d   e   f   g
    h i j k l m n o

And we get a query where the start key matches leaf i and the end key matches leaf k.

We would return the key/value pairs from i,j,k. We would also return a,b,d,i,e,k as boundary nodes. These boundary nodes cover the paths from the root (a) to the start and end keys (leaves i and k). Note that there is quite a bit of redundant information returned here; more than necessary to prove presence of i,j,k in the trie. This might be changed in the full protocol; it&#x27;s defined this way to hopefully make the boundary proof easy to build and verify.

If we get a query where the start key is _not_ in the trie, it is a bit more complicated as the boundary nodes need to cover the path where this key _would_ be found, if it was in the trie (in order to prove absence). If we imagine, for example, the same query but with the start key changed so it is greater than i&#x27;s key but would still be found at the location of i in the trie. In that case, we would only return the key/value pairs from j and k, but the returned boundary nodes would be the same (a,b,d,i,e,k).

Not clear how I am supposed to run this? Looking through the implementation though I can see a few things that are not correct:

- Message size should be little-endian on the wire, as stated in the SNP doc.
- The block announcement protocol is supposed to be _persistent_ (hence the persistent in UP). In this repo it seems like it is opened for a single announcement and then closed again.
- The block announcement stream should be opened only by the peer which initiated the connection.
- The certificate&#x27;s alternative name should be checked against its public key, see the SNP doc for details. The point of this is just to make things look more like the Web 2.0 case, which is what most QUIC libraries are designed to handle.
- Your handling of the connection&lt;-&gt;public key association seems pretty sketchy, particularly considering that it is possible AFAIK to have multiple QUIC connections with the same IP:port endpoint.</div>

The index of a validator is simply its position in the validator key list in the state. Is this what you weren&#x27;t sure about or something else?</div>

By this I mean if some node X connects to another node Y, node Y has to figure out which validator index X in the state it is.  Both X and Y have some ed25519 pub key, which are used in the TLS handshake with self-signed certs as per <a href="https://github.com/zdave-parity/jam-np/blob/main/simple.md#encryption-and-handshake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/zdave-parity/jam-np/blob/main/simple.md#encryption-and-handshake</a> -- so both X and Y use their [genesis] state -- something like <a href="https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/blob/main/traces/safrole/genesis.json#L81-L118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/blob/main/traces/safrole/genesis.json#L81-L118</a> which use develop -- to basically map the pub key from the cert into a validator index in that state.  

That&#x27;s the first part, which gets all the basic niceties of TLS mapping into validator indexes out of the way

Then the second part is everything here down to the exact &quot;Unique Persistent&quot; part

<div class='msg'><time>2024-11-08 17:00</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#9b6fdc'>olanod</span>: Random thought, perhaps off-topic...I was very briefly checking <a href="https://github.com/hyperlight-dev/hyperlight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperlight</a> and their &quot;micro vms&quot; concept, it looks interesting and familiar to what we see with WASM runtimes or PolkaVM. Assuming 99% of chain infrastructure runs on x86_64 linux, would it be reasonable to support chain infrastructure running sandboxed binaries of the same architecture as the host machines?(&quot;polkavm micro vms&quot; should still be possible).</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-11-08 17:19</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Firstly, PVM is already pretty close in ISA to x86_64, by design, so x86 code should not be too hard to express as PVM. The harder part is making the I/O work - CPUs enjoy a much greater memory/disk random access bandwidth than blockchains due to the need to ferry data and prove correctness to all nodes involved in verifying. Secondly, the really hard part for a trustless ISA is gas accounting. A lot more becomes possible with effective secure deterministic metering and hyperlight doesn’t make any efforts to support this afaict.  <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-11-11 18:47</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#83c95e'>tebdev</span>: Good question and observation danicuki ! I have had clients that chose Corda and Hyperledger for this reason and others rolled their own blockchain e.g. JP Chase. Also does the Validator have a transport confidentiality requirement that justifies use of TLS? That then leads us to key lifecycle questions. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-11-11 20:36</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: TLS is primarily for peer authentication and ensuring data integrity. The privacy aspect is not particularly important though it does matter in some cases (e.g. Safrole tickets would not be anonymous if everyone could see where they came from)</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-11-11 20:42</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: Re privacy within JAM, everything is public so anyone can see what is being computed. It would presumably be possible to have private computation in a service using ZK stuff though</div>

The privacy aspect is not particularly important though it does matter in some cases (e.g. Safrole tickets would not be anonymous if everyone could see where they came from)

Thank you for clarifying. If I read this right the secuirty requirements are 1) authentication 2) data integrity (transport versus payload(Tx, Extrensic) ? ). Can you help me understand risk of Safrole ticket confidentiality requirement?</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-11-11 20:58</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: One of the goals of Safrole is to keep the identity of the selected block authors secret up until the point they actually author their blocks, to prevent them being DoSed for example. Tickets themselves are anonymous due to the RingVRF magic, but it is also important that the way tickets are distributed does not reveal their author. This is achieved by first sending each generated ticket to a randomly selected &quot;proxy&quot; validator who then distributes the ticket more widely. Anyone who sees this ticket get sent to the proxy validator can infer who created it so the sending should be private. Of course the proxy validator could itself be compromised, this is hopefully rare!</div>

Re security requirements, for the transport between validators we definitely need authentication and integrity, otherwise the security arguments for the protocols built on top will fall apart</div>

Not sure what the question is exactly, sorry. You can argue that the blessed service is a central authority because it decides the next validator set. But assuming you trust the previously elected validator set, this service just behaves according to its code, which in practice will elect validators based on the staking decisions of Dot holders; there is no central authority.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-11-11 23:27</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4cbfa8'>xlchen</span>: I don’t really understand the question but there is some kind of chain of trust for validator keys. The root is genesis validators. And then via beefy/grandpa anyone can validate if a block is sealed by a current validator by proofs and exposed identity will be validator keys, which include ipv6 address in metadata</div>

Good point, but staking is a gate that Polkadot can up/down vote . If Validator approved how does the QUIC get a key it will trust. This goes back to your &quot;fall down&quot; comment to avoid a bad actor/imposter</div>

NO arguments from me, trying to walk it down to get my head around it, Blessed Service = (Some Polkadot Community) = (Distributed Authority) --&gt; Issue keys (X.509, EC, Dual Key Pair) = Certificate.

<div class='msg'><time>2024-11-12 00:19</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: Not sure what you mean by (X.509, EC, Dual Key Pair) = Certificate. Each validator has 2 public keys at the moment: an Ed25519 public key and a &quot;Bandersnatch&quot; public key. These are the keys that are provided when the blessed service specifies a new validator set. The nodes generate their own certificates containing their Ed25519 key. This is done only to keep the TLS protocol happy. The certificates are self-signed but these signatures are not expected to be checked. FWIW I wouldn&#x27;t say the authority &quot;issues&quot; keys but rather selects keys that have been previously generated by nodes.</div>

I was being figurative in speech to say a dual key pair of a mutually agreed type. I may have got ahead of myself with &quot;Certificate.&quot; If I am validator and I can be slashed, I would want a trust chain for this key signed and sealed by whomever sent it to me e.g. a &quot;Certificate&quot; ... This could be a Tx Extrinsic signature or a self contained root chain like X.509. QUIC and TLS best practice is X.509 to handle numerous risk scenarios. </div>

In that case you need a certificate chain and trusted root to establish a link between google.com and a public key. In the case of JAM, we start with a public key so the certificate stuff is all somewhat pointless. It&#x27;s just hoop jumping so that the protocol can be implemented without having to hack around with QUIC libraries too much. In a perfect world we would just use some noise protocol (<a href="http://www.noiseprotocol.org/)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.noiseprotocol.org/)</a> and there would be no certificates involved.</div>

We are using the links to the reader heavily in our code (duh!) and I think this kind of tool would make perfect sense.
I&#x27;ve passed that to the team and I think we can figure something out.

There is no need to parse HTML, because the reader link contains synctex blocks which point exactly to the latex source line that contains the selection. So it&#x27;s just a matter of checking if that particular latex source line has been changed between versions.</div>

IMHO it&#x27;s better to just use <code>31-byte</code> for everything. I don&#x27;t see a reason for this extra byte being useful at all.

Also I&#x27;d love to see the node hash truncated to 255bits everywhere to allow trie manipulation without recomputing the hash. If you merkelize everything from scratch, there is obviously no issue, but if you allow adding/removing nodes it&#x27;s sometimes required to recompute the last bit in case the node moves from left to right branch.</div>

 I was also present at the Tuesday meetup. I can assure you we did not discuss anything that violates (collusion) prize rules. That said, I am no longer in Bangkok now.
 Discussion on Tuesday was mostly related to:  1. Awareness of tooling that is already present and useful for everyone (e.g. fluffylabs)

2. Creating a list of things that would be useful besides the implementations (such as telemetry, explorer, cli flags, docker, RPC, other uis, etc)

3. Some coordination/scoping of M1, M2 priorities in order to have some form of cross-client testnet as initiated by Colorful Notion with useful phases to get implementer teams on board.

4. Discussion on having a (private) monthly call for implementers to further discuss on these topics. 
It would be great if we can get notes out here on the chat. 1. To be transparent, 2. To follow up with actionable items. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

This is &quot;noise&quot; in the grand scheme of everything in present day.  The way they approach OP Stack (Base, Optimism, ..) is running private prover networks so latency is reduced.  You scale the private prover network based on how many &quot;cycles&quot; the prover needs.  To prove ETH needs ~ 25 Million cycles/sec, requiring a certain number  + kind of GPU to achieve (e.g. 50-100 GPUs of Nvidia L4s) <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Or should there be just ONE trustless JAM supercomputer?

I believe on this question of what we can sell with X JAM Chain is about 
(a) the technical problem (with elegance of &quot;coprocessors&quot;) re beefy finality 
and
(b) the social problem of tribalism + branding (of &quot;Polkadot Cloud&quot; being the only place for JAM protocol vs X JAM Chain for X ecosystem for X = {Polkadot, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Cardano, X/DOGE ...}).  
If the JAM protocol wants us to do its bidding (instead of us wanting the JAM protocol to do our bidding) then how should JAM ecosystem participants vs DOT stakeholders reason about problems (a) vs (b).   Can you provide guidance on both problems? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-11-21 12:12</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#a8a636'>darkartistry</span>: The monthly cost of a 1 Gbps (Gigabit per second) connection in data centers varies based on several factors, including geographic location, service provider, and specific service requirements. Here’s an overview:

Geographic Variations:
	•	North America and Europe: In these regions, transit costs are relatively low. For instance, a 1 Gbps connection might be priced around $10 per Mbps per month, totaling approximately $10,000 monthly. However, actual prices are often lower due to competition and peering agreements. ￼
	•	Asia: Transit pricing is significantly higher, approximately seven times that of North America and Europe. This means a 1 Gbps connection could cost around $70,000 per month. Peering arrangements can reduce this cost, but the effective price remains higher than in Western regions. ￼

Service Provider Examples:
	•	Dedicated Internet Access (DIA): For a 1 Gbps DIA circuit, prices can vary. A general guide suggests that any 500 Mbps+ DIA circuit priced under $1,000 per month is considered a solid deal, though this is typically outside data centers. ￼
	•	Colocation Services: Colocation providers often offer bandwidth as part of their packages. For example, some providers include 1 Gbps connections in their colocation plans, with overall monthly costs ranging from $79 for a single server to $599 for a full rack. These prices encompass space, power, and bandwidth. ￼

Additional Considerations:
	•	Peering vs. Transit: Engaging in peering agreements can significantly reduce bandwidth costs compared to purchasing transit from Tier 1 providers. The extent of peering varies by region and provider.
	•	Data Center Location: Data centers in regions with higher operational costs, such as Asia, may charge more for bandwidth. Conversely, facilities in areas with lower costs may offer more competitive pricing.
	•	Service Level Agreements (SLAs): Premium SLAs with guaranteed uptime and performance may increase costs.

In summary, while a 1 Gbps connection in data centers can range from under $1,000 to over $70,000 per month, the actual cost depends on various factors, including location, provider, and specific service requirements. It’s advisable to consult directly with data center providers to obtain accurate and tailored pricing.</div>

For example, some providers include 1 Gbps connections in their colocation plans, with overall monthly costs ranging from $79 for a single server to $599 for a full rack. These prices encompass space, power, and bandwidth. ￼
&gt; 
&gt; Additional Considerations:
&gt; 	•	Peering vs. Transit: Engaging in peering agreements can significantly reduce bandwidth costs compared to purchasing transit from Tier 1 providers. The extent of peering varies by region and provider.
&gt; 	•	Data Center Location: Data centers in regions with higher operational costs, such as Asia, may charge more for bandwidth. Conversely, facilities in areas with lower costs may offer more competitive pricing.
&gt; 	•	Service Level Agreements (SLAs): Premium SLAs with guaranteed uptime and performance may increase costs.
&gt; 
&gt; In summary, while a 1 Gbps connection in data centers can range from under $1,000 to over $70,000 per month, the actual cost depends on various factors, including location, provider, and specific service requirements. It’s advisable to consult directly with data center providers to obtain accurate and tailored pricing.

I propose something similar for &quot;output&quot; in test vectors. Why do we have this &quot;output&quot;? Why don&#x27;t simple put every side effect of STF into post_state branch?

For exemple, here:

<pre><code class=''>consume_authorization_once-1.json

            &quot;reported&quot;: [
                {
                    &quot;work_package_hash&quot;: &quot;0x63c03371b9dad9f1c60473ec0326c970984e9c90c0b5ed90eba6ada471ba4d86&quot;,

                }
            ],
            &quot;reporters&quot;: [
                &quot;0x22351e22105a19aabb42589162ad7f1ea0df1c25cebf0e4a9fcd261301274862&quot;,
                &quot;0x5c7f34a4bd4f2d04076a8c6f9060a0c8d2c6bdd082ceb3eda7df381cb260faff&quot;,

            ]
</code></pre>

would it be better to put these &quot;output&quot; into ρ  on post_state?</div>

- in the state part of the .json (<code>&amp;quot;pre_state&amp;quot;</code> or <code>&amp;quot;post_state&amp;quot;</code>) we have fields <code>bytes</code> and <code>items</code> =&gt; what do they represent in the GP ? If I go to the chapter 9,service accounts, I see <code>s</code>, <code>p</code>, <code>l</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>g</code>, <code>m</code> but I don&#x27;t see what fields they could represent.

I feel there is something I&#x27;m not seeing. Also there are 6 fields in the .json but the GP has 7 elements.
- I put here a question I put in a comment (just to centralize my questions): in the <code>&amp;quot;output&amp;quot;</code> field we have the field <code>&amp;quot;reported&amp;quot;</code> =&gt; what variable in the GP does it represent ? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Over the past few weeks, the FluffyLabs team has been finalizing the first official release of the PVM Debugger (<a href="https://pvm.fluffylabs.dev)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://pvm.fluffylabs.dev).</a> Alongside this, we’re preparing a proposal for retroactive funding from the Polkadot Treasury to support the development of this tool. We also plan to continue expanding its features in the near future.

We’ve started a discussion about the planned Treasury proposal on Polkassembly: <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/2578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/2578</a> and would greatly appreciate your feedback. Please don’t hesitate to ask any questions or share your thoughts!</div>

What would be a good place to figure out if it&#x27;s actually a good idea? General treasury seems to be a more of a beaten track, but we are open for discussion.</div>

Yes, debugging large programs is yet to be figured out. The low hanging fruits that come to my mind (and we have them on our roadmap) are:
1. Supporting/folding basic blocks
2. Supporting debug symbols

We already support running two PVMs in parallel and stopping on the first difference. So comparing to reference implementation should be easy, figuring out why the code is not working correctly for given set of inputs (actually debugging the program in question) might need some extra work.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-11-26 18:21</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: As soon as polkatool + CoreChains (presumably a very very large service) has &quot;eureka!&quot; from PolkaJAM (in solving the same problem as the Polkadot Relay Chain does for a couple dozen blocks), every JAM implementer will be able to use this to support matching the same results, which probably will touch almost everything in Appendix A + B.  

However, its critical to have the scope include all the host functions to take a &quot;PVM debugger&quot; seriously, which means you kind of have to extend out to the &quot;host&quot; with a reasonably complex &quot;X Context&quot; \[accumulate\] and &quot;(m,e)&quot; \[refine\], extending to  imported segments, gas details, and probably a bunch of other host state.  Having a well defined interface (RPC + codec) between a JAM implementation _with host state_ and the PVM Debugger is a must, and hopefully only take a day to wire up.  I imagine you&#x27;d need to have a codec test vectors for this { XContext, m, e, i, ... } state to make this tractable + useful for the challenging cases?

If you have all that in scope, it would be wonderful. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Indeed. So far we were trying to keep the tool as JAM-agnostic as possible, so it may help not only JAM-PVM but also for instance revive (Solidity to PVM compiler).

Next on our roadmap is to support more JAM-specific features (entry points), support host calls and have &quot;mocked&quot; JAM host calls implementation (for instance specialised UI where you can provide the segments to be available for <code>export</code> host call, etc).
Connecting to a running JAM node to invoke host calls is something worth considering as well, I will add that to our issue tracker.</div>

<a href="https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/tree/main/services/parity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/tree/main/services/parity</a>

0. Does Parity Rust JAM SDK completely phase out Jan&#x27;s polkatool?
1. What is the recommended way to disassemble the <code>jam-pvm-build</code>- built PVM byte code ?

<pre><code class=''># cargo run -p polkatool disassemble --show-raw-bytes ~/go/src/github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/services/parity/jam-bootstrap-service.pvm

</code></pre>

2. Does the program start with the 5x4 = 20 bytes of jumps
<a href="https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/blob/main/services/jam-duna/bootstrap/bootstrap.txt#L10-L17" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/blob/main/services/jam-duna/bootstrap/bootstrap.txt#L10-L17</a>
3. Can we build 32-bit vs 64-bit until the end of Jan/Feb/March with this?    How do we specify the 32 vs 64 target?
4. The 72K is surprisingly large, because it went for instructions in the payload with full generality 😅  --  Our first bootstrap code is ~200 bytes, hand built
<a href="https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/blob/main/services/jam-duna/bootstrap/bootstrap.txt#L8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/blob/main/services/jam-duna/bootstrap/bootstrap.txt#L8</a>
We will try redoing it in this Parity SDK with a &quot;barebones&quot; mindset in a 32-bit or 64-bit way, but is the expectation that the bootstrap will actually be this big in the end?  Is there some code blob reuse _across services_ that is desired, e.g. for super common operations like hashing

5. Work Item ABI  -- earlier you said &quot;Services are not smart contracts&quot;, but I&#x27;m glad you referred to it this way -- how would you see the end Bootstrap described in ABI form?
6. Any way to slip in some assembly code? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

In a completely ordinary way, I think the term &quot;SUPERcomputer&quot; works on people well because of the superhero vs hero distinction that loosely maps onto your favorite word &quot;Core&quot;, which ALSO works for everyday PC computer buyers.

Concretely, I hope GP Sec 18 can incorporate the JAM-to-JAM process alongside the MMB nitty gritty, developed early between { Polkadot, Kusama, Paseo/Westend } JAM chain (maybe even in the Toaster!) or at least charted in Sec 20+ in a JAM 2.0 roadmap.

Apologies if this is too pushy ... but I believe there needs to be an equally insanely great vision for (homogenous) &quot;Polkadot \[Asset\] Hubs&quot; running across that grid, with clarity on how DOT can work across the grid.  I believe the poor messaging situation in OP&#x27;s superchain can be easily attacked, but it seems to be a &quot;if you can&#x27;t beat them, join them&quot; and we need a hijacking plan here.

This is too good of a vision to be locked inside this chat room -- can you get on like Unchained to share your vision

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-11-28 12:38</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: What I would aim to achieve with Grid scaling is JAM-style weak-coherency.

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-11-28 12:44</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: This would result CorePlay having existing JAM-style per-core synchronous composition for those transactors willing to pay for it, but with massively scalable (and therefore very cheap) asynchronous composition for everyone else. Since CorePlay would be continuations-based, high-quality primitives abound for minimising the pain of asynch programming. The main difference shouldn&#x27;t be DevEx, but rather very particular functionality which strictly requires synchroneity (&quot;Stop-The-World&quot;) in execution like flash-loans.</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-11-28 10:16</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: There&#x27;s still some stuff to be worked out, like preimage fetching/sharing across JAMs (possibly a simple cache model would do, or perhaps also an explicit fetch) and DA handoff as the partitioning changes (possibly just ephemeral connections across JAM validator partitions for segment-fetching). <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

in different testing modes to match the goals of M1 vs M2 vs M3 as well as which extrinsics.  I think we should have a super precise answer for M1 Import Blocks now?

My guess is:

- &quot;M1 Import blocks&quot; will have blocks that change the state of:

    - C(4), C(6), C(7), C(8), C(9), C(10), C(11), C(13), C(15)
    - all service storage (δ, a\_s, a\_p, a\_l)
    - extrinsics E\_{T,G,A,P}

... implying these will happen later:

- M2/M3: C(1), C(2), C(3), C(5), C(12), C(14), E\_D

Can someone clarify what M1 Import Blocks state changes should cover?

This has implications as to what teams should focus on finishing in what order.   I remember earlier comments that M1 doesn&#x27;t even need PVM implementation, which is at odds with the above guess.

This is important for the design+implementation of a fuzz tester that only generates blocks suitable for each milestone / mode, with a parameter like &quot;mode&quot; that is like
M1: &quot;fallback&quot; (no extrinsics), &quot;safrole&quot; (only ticket extrinsics), &quot;assurances&quot; (all but dispute extrinsics and no prereqs)
M2: &quot;orderedaccumulation&quot; (adjusting C(14), including prereqs), &quot;authorization&quot; (adjusting C(1)+C(2)), &quot;recenthistory&quot; (C(3)), &quot;blessed&quot; (adjusting C(5), C(12)), &quot;basichostfunctions&quot; (most common host functions)
M3: &quot;finalization&quot; (everything in C(1)-C(15) except disputes), &quot;disputes&quot; (everything, including dispute extrinsics), &quot;conformance&quot; (every single host function) <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

&gt; <a href="https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/293bf5a/348e00348e00" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev/#/293bf5a/348e00348e00</a>
&gt; in different testing modes to match the goals of M1 vs M2 vs M3 as well as which extrinsics.  I think we should have a super precise answer for M1 Import Blocks now?
&gt; 
&gt; My guess is:
&gt; 
&gt; - &quot;M1 Import blocks&quot; will have blocks that change the state of:
&gt; 
&gt;     - C(4), C(6), C(7), C(8), C(9), C(10), C(11), C(13), C(15)
&gt;     - all service storage (δ, a\_s, a\_p, a\_l)
&gt;     - extrinsics E\_{T,G,A,P}
&gt; 
&gt; ... implying these will happen later:
&gt; 
&gt; - M2/M3: C(1), C(2), C(3), C(5), C(12), C(14), E\_D
&gt; 
&gt; Can someone clarify what M1 Import Blocks state changes should cover?
&gt; 
&gt; This has implications as to what teams should focus on finishing in what order.   I remember earlier comments that M1 doesn&#x27;t even need PVM implementation, which is at odds with the above guess.
&gt; 
&gt; This is important for the design+implementation of a fuzz tester that only generates blocks suitable for each milestone / mode, with a parameter like &quot;mode&quot; that is like
&gt; M1: &quot;fallback&quot; (no extrinsics), &quot;safrole&quot; (only ticket extrinsics), &quot;assurances&quot; (all but dispute extrinsics and no prereqs)
&gt; M2: &quot;orderedaccumulation&quot; (adjusting C(14), including prereqs), &quot;authorization&quot; (adjusting C(1)+C(2)), &quot;recenthistory&quot; (C(3)), &quot;blessed&quot; (adjusting C(5), C(12)), &quot;basichostfunctions&quot; (most common host functions)
&gt; M3: &quot;finalization&quot; (everything in C(1)-C(15) except disputes), &quot;disputes&quot; (everything, including dispute extrinsics), &quot;conformance&quot; (every single host function)

hey davxy thanks for this. I previously used your <code>polkajam-vectors</code> branch but i noticed that compared to the upstream repository gamma_z is computed differently (my findings were that a different version of ark repo was used.) caan you share some insights on which of the 2 provide the &quot;correct&quot; gamma_z computation?</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-11-30 10:51</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c9419d'>davxy</span>: I checked the value of <code>gamma_z</code> and is the same in both the upstream PR and my fork.
Obviously if for upstream you mean the master branch, yes. This is different. At this point master is quite outdated.
I suggest you to work with the changes in the PR or using my fork, that I try to keep updated WRT the open PRs we have upstream.

I report the **current** values here:

<div class='msg'><time>2024-12-01 11:55</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: So we&#x27;ve recently switched to a 64-bit PVM in the GP. I haven&#x27;t got the updated the test vectors ready yet (I will have them ready soon-ish), but in case some of you are already looking to update your PVM implementations to 64-bit here are some tips to make this process easier:

- <em>The</em> major change introduced with the 64-bit PVM is that the registers are now 64-bit, and in case of the most of the instructions their behavior stays essentially exactly the same, except they operate on 64-bit values instead of on 32-bit values now.
- The instruction encoding is unchanged. Those instructions which previously took at most a 32-bit immediate value (like e.g. <code>and_imm</code>) now still can have at most a 32-bit <em>physical</em> immediate, <em>however</em> the immediate value is now sign extended to full 64-bit before being used.
- There&#x27;s only a <em>single</em> instruction which takes a 64-bit immediate that is actually <em>physically</em> encoded in the code stream as 64-bit (<code>load_imm_64</code>)
- There are a couple of instructions where there exists both a 64-bit variant and a 32-bit variant. (e.g. <code>add_32</code> and <code>add_64</code>) The <code>_32</code> variants work like the old 32-bit instruction from 0.4 - they ignore the upper 32-bits of the registers and use only the lower bits, but their result is <em>always</em> sign extended to full 64-bits when written to the destination register.
- The address space is still 32-bit and memory accesses ignore the upper 32-bits of registers.

If any of you have trouble updating your PVMs or have any questions regarding PVM then, as always, feel free to ping me and I&#x27;ll be happy to help.</div>

We have been using polkatool to build a few test services in 32-bit =) and are trying out building the same with the Parity Rust SDK.  Is polkatool going to be 64-bit soon or is it 64-bit already under certain flag / conditions or 64-bit already?

My suggestions is to use offenders, but ender psi branch:

Psi: {
 offenders: [...]

This is how it is in disputes vectors, which for me makes much more sense. Offenders under the main state branch seems odd, as state doesn&#x27;t have an &quot;offenders&quot; component. </div>

However, the state in question is not the &quot;main&quot; state. Only the relevant portions of the state required to advance the STF of a particular subsystem are included. 

In cases of &quot;disputes&quot; vectors, the entire ψ is necessary, while &quot;reports&quot; STF requires only ψₒ. I don&#x27;t think that including items that are not strictly needed is beneficial, which is why for example, I have not included other state items here. 

I recognize that this approach is based on personal preference. However, since there is no formal specification for how to write vectors, I believe it is more efficient to exclude elements not required by the subsystem&#x27;s STF. 

If anyone wishes to draft a mini-specification for writing vectors, I encourage you to open an issue on GitHub to address these considerations. Of course, I will eventually adapt my approach to the issue outcome. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

You keep the consistency among different test vectors, while excluding unneeded elements.

Its best to have a single benevolent dictator have good consistent taste than have any inconsistency in this.   The style is roughly in place already, lets not change it!

For STF test vectors:

- raw k,v values in JSON with a little bit of metadata for service storage sufficient to derive the key and know its type will be best.
- having a comprehensive dump of raw k,v values for the &quot;pre\_state&quot; is necessary, ideally coupled with this metadata;
- for the post\_state, its a debate as to whether to have a comprehensive dump of k,v state along with this metadata.  Its easier to read/write but a tad harder to spot the differences without writing a little diff code.
- Having the post state root is desirable but not strictly necessary.
- Having a JAM codec version of an STF test vector might be useful or unnecessary.  But, in general, the W3F test vectors being in both JSON + JAM Codec shuts down unnecessary debates effectively.  In all cases, having W3F be the benevolent dictator is very useful so we don&#x27;t have engineers bickering over formats. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

The segments are erasure-coded and distributed to the validators. Each validator receives a single shard out of the 1,023 shards, determined by their validator index. Therefore, the shard index of the shard they receive equals to their validator index.

According to the JAMNP protocol, to fetch data from the assurers, we need to provide each assurer with the shard index we require from them.

The exported segments are expected to remain available for 28 days. During this period, it is assumed that more than 341 validators will remain consistent. However, there is still a significant likelihood that validator indexes may change during this time due to the addition or removal of validators.

Given this, should we also maintain a record of the validator keys associated with each shard index? This would allow us to identify which validator holds a specific shard, regardless of changes in their validator index.

Finally, is the assumption that more than 341 validators will remain unchanged for 28 days accurate? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

New validators will need to fetch the last ~28 days of block history anyway to build the SR-&gt;ER mapping. I believe this map can be built using _only_ the blocks, without requiring any state to be fetched. Unfortunately as-is I don&#x27;t think the old validator sets can be determined just by looking at the blocks, as I don&#x27;t think the epoch marker in the header includes all the necessary information. Seems like it might be a good idea to change this, but maybe there is a different way to make it work.

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-12-04 19:34</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c86f85'>amritj</span>: If from the current validator set we know the validators that are active during the epoch the work package was executed, we can just send them the erasure root and ask them the shard they have and they will share the shard with it&#x27;s index and ofcourse justification data so we can verify it.

And about knowing which validators were active during our work package epoch, I think we can store a status component like we do in preimages in the validator metadata which somehow tell us the epoch indexes the validator was active

- &quot;input&quot; is stuff found in the block: extrinsic and header
- &quot;state&quot; are the relevant bits found in the global state relevant to push forward the STF.

Said that,
- some of these state bits may be &quot;prime&quot;, &quot;dagger&quot; or double dagger (see asn.1 for semantics)
- some of these bits are changed by the STF, while some others not. 

This may result in data redundancy. But otherwise I had to introduce a different struct for posterior state. I found this easier. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

But in practice, in both cases, it appears there is a pretty serious &quot;no\_std&quot; requirement ... that makes it hard to put Rust packages using <code>std</code> into PolkaVM Contracts or JAM Services.  They quickly hit this &quot;error\[E0463\]: can&#x27;t find crate for <code>std</code>&quot;!  This leaves us reaching out for a host function and a &#x27;ecalli ___` as a &quot;cheat code&quot; to avoid rewriting the underlying dependencies on std packages, and thus get a revive-pallet based contract and/or JAM Service.

I would suggest literally the following:

ecdsa_recover
ecdsa_to_eth_address
hash_blake2_128
hash_blake2_256
hash_keccak_256
hash_sha2_256
sr25519_verify

Skeptical these should be interpreted PVM byte code, but putting that nag aside, having a whole host of them in bootstrap code and a idiomatic way of accessing them with invoke or similar seems justified.   It seems wild for everyone to have their own versions of these in their own service code, but this will lead to some nice performance tests a side effect.  

For pedantic reasons hope you will consider: 
block_number, code_hash, now, minimum_balance
own_code_hash [invoke?]
and for parity: 
xcm_execute, xcm_send [??]
depending on how transfer and xcm are related.

&quot;info!&quot; and debug_message could be massaged together.

All of this is deterministic but the first group has a lot of opinionated stuff on what is a worthy crypto primitive between edwards, bls and bandersnatch signature verification to consider.

Generally, from <a href="https://contracts.polkadot.io/tutorial/rust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> we want JAM Service builders and Polkadot Hub contract builders to have minimal friction between {Rust, ...} code built with the JAM SDK vs revive, even though the former is meant for rollups and the latter is for end users.   </div>

(a) for performance testing interpreted PVM implementations  ala/within JIP-1 101..107 -- we&#x27;d compare calling the &quot;native&quot; unofficial host implementation against a PVM implementation against whatever Westend Hub does in { clock time, gas } -- its apples to apples 
(b) for abstractions within the JAM (Rust) SDK that simply call some bootstrap &quot;polyfilled&quot; PVM code.
These are not JAM protocol additions forever etched in but abstractions and measurements.</div>

I suppose loading data into the DA layer can be done independently by the light client but some clients might be very light and won&#x27;t even have the memory to hold and upload the resources they want for refinement.</div>

I was thinking of a set up without the equivalent of a parachain with collators, for sure we would do that if there&#x27;s no other option but if I understand correctly there will be services like CoreJAM where a light client directly connected to said validators could call a function of a JAM service? that service could have sourced data at an earlier stage.</div>

No</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-12-09 11:41</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#6de2b4'>weigen</span>: I thought a work package have mostly four work items and each work item only has one segment root</div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-12-10 09:59</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#6de2b4'>weigen</span>: Hi, I&#x27;m a little confused after reading the paged proof part.Can I confirm that I understand it correctly?

Focusing on the work package export part, work items will export segments, and these segments will form a Merkle Tree with a constant depth. The Merkle Root of this tree will become the segment root in the work report.
Paged-proofs function will page the Merkle Tree built by the export segments, and each page will have 64 segments. Each segment will have a Merkle Proof (paged-proof) to the subtree root (tree of each page). The paged-proofs function will output the leaves (hashes of each segment), and each segment&#x27;s Merkle Proof to the subtree root.

Is this understanding correct?

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-12-09 12:37</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: Not sure I understand the question. Do you mean when an announcement is made claiming some no-shows, how these no-shows can be proved/verified?</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-12-09 12:48</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c86f85'>amritj</span>: Yes, we pass a list of no-show auditors for every WR we intend to audit after tranche 0

The no-show data contain validator index and their audit announcement, so we can verify that the auditor really announced if they will audit the WR.

<a href="https://github.com/zdave-parity/jam-np/blob/5d374b53578cdd93646e3ee19e2b19ea132317b8/simple.md?plain=1#L656" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/zdave-parity/jam-np/blob/5d374b53578cdd93646e3ee19e2b19ea132317b8/simple.md?plain=1#L656</a>

But to verify the announcement, we need the original message that contains the full list of reports the no-show auditor announced

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-12-09 12:51</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: Everything needed to verify the no-shows should be included</div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-12-09 12:53</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: FWIW you can just verify the signatures of the no-show announcements</div>

Maybe I am misunderstanding but they are included here? <code>Announcement = len++[Core Index ++ Work-Report Hash] ++ Ed25519 Signature</code></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-12-09 12:56</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c86f85'>amritj</span>: Aah, I got confused by the definition of announcement in the graypaper and thought only announcement signature was included</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-12-09 18:55</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: (a) could be done trivially without the trouble of defining a multi client standard host function to implement. 
(b) I see little point of this other than for code deduplication. In that case if it’s a serious issue we should allow for code-importing in a more sensible way. </div>

But for large scale testing, a state_transitions format (pre_state [with state_root], block, post_state [with state_root]) (in both JSON + JAM Codec form) would likely be better across all STF test vectors:

How can you differentiate these two cases when a field remais the same in post state:

case (a): the STF should not change the value
case (b): the transition for that particular field is not being executed in that particular test vector

About parser, you don&#x27;t need to create two parsers. If a field is missing, your parser simply ignore all inexistent fields</div>

The dependency graph says that only these state components should be used as input and only those are modified as output.

This would make it easier to identify which parts failed when test vectors fail.

For example, in the case of work reports, the miscellaneous field could include guarantor assignments and previous guarantor assignments. This way, if someone encounters a failing test vector, they could check whether the issue is related to these assignments or something else.

This is valuable not merely because {s, h, ... } is &quot;lossy&quot; going into k, but because we can quickly reason about (really, grep for) keys, values over many states quickly.   This makes it easy for us to settle debates within our team quickly and others if we all post something similar.  Having 2 extra values in the k,v serialization is simpler than putting it in more verbose pre-serialized state representation.  We&#x27;re not super wedded to any specific metadata format for the 4 service k,v - but prefer non-JSON to have simple &quot;cut&quot; work rather than complex json attribute extraction (so, as you can see above, |-separated, space separated, then =-separated).

<div class='msg'><time>2024-12-12 20:11</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c9419d'>davxy</span>: My 2 cents regarding the test vectors format discussion. As the conversation seems to be getting somewhat scattered, I suggest moving it to a dedicated GitHub issue. Personally, (of course) I believe that the current one is the best format for the moment, but that&#x27;s just my opinion.

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-12-12 23:30</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#5e86de'>boymaas</span>: Personally, I appreciate the current format, as I don’t see any advantage in changing it.

<div class='msg reply'><time>2024-12-13 05:52</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#be2950'>clearloop</span>: imo the current test vectors format are good enough for unit tests (test implementations separately)

apart from the unit tests, clients may need other format for integration tests ( mb for rpc or p2p ), however, even though **new formats**, I believe wrapping the current test vectors&#x27; format is the best choice for efficiency &gt; &lt;</div>

I have doubt about a safrole vector &quot;enact-epoch-change-with-padding-1&quot;

My gamma\_z (epoch root) is not matching the vector&#x27;s - may be something related with the zeroed offender key. From what I understood, we should zero the offender key before calculating the ring commitment root. This zero is a 32 zero bytes. Did anyone could make this vector pass?

Also considering several implementors said they aligned with the PR provided vectors (which again is not in spec of gp) made me appreciate even more the clean room implementation rule.

1- I wonder if, in a sense, it will look like CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type) world state. Or it will not be at this level but rather at a low level like several VMs: (start, stop, resume, VM state) with ability to communicate together through exposed APIs.

2- Another question: is Solid (from Tim Berners-Lee), separation of concerns - data, app, identity - will be a guideline in the design of Core Play?

3- Last question: I envision here <a href="https://forum.nextgraph.org/#narrow/stream/3-devs/topic/ISCC.20metadata.20on.20Document/near/776" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://forum.nextgraph.org/#narrow/stream/3-devs/topic/ISCC.20metadata.20on.20Document/near/776</a> that Jam could be a notary anchor for a Document-based system, is that correct?

<div class='msg'><time>2024-12-21 20:25</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Define everyday users. Define interact.</div>

“Everyday users” are individuals who engage with dApps by signing transactions/extrinsics/messages using a wallet solely under their control, typically resulting in state changes to one or more chains.

To “interact” with one or more smart contracts (revive contract with Coreplay powers TBD) means to invoke a method they expose in order to effect those changes.

With Polkadot Hub pallet-revive deployed in 2025, everyday users will interact with revive-compiled smart contracts, yay!    There is a direct vs indirect qualification added on whether everyday users interact with JAM.   Users interact _directly_ with Polkadot Hub in that their signed extrinsics make it onto Polkadot Hub (revive or not) -- for revive, they could, if they chose, look at the material they are signing, go check out the methods in a verified revive contract and see how Solidity code map into storage changes in some Solidity contract interfaces on Etherscan PolkaVM block explorer.   But through these same interactions everyday users will _indirectly_ interact with JAM, through the JAM CoreChains service validating workpackages containing segments related to these signed extrinsics; but users will have absolutely no idea how JAM machinery works to do that -- its cognitively impenetrable except for the fellows.  This is how the &quot;JAM services are not for everyday users _directly_&quot; is accurate, how the &quot;there are no transactions on JAM&quot; makes sense, even though the bits of workpackages are _about_ them.  Did I get that right?

If Coreplay is both a JAM Service and an upgrade of pallet-revive, it would be great to have some comprehensible revision to the above ending up with &quot;everyday users DIRECTLY interact with JAM through Coreplay/revive&quot; that harnesses the INSANE amount of trustless supercomputing power available.  No idea what that means for the &quot;Cloud vs Hub&quot; vocab, and I don&#x27;t want it to delay 1.0 ratification 😅.  But avoiding hard forks with xyz on integration/co-scheduling in prep for this supremely high impact 2.0 on the roadmap is critical?  </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-12-21 20:28</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Coreplay might reasonably be an upgrade path from pallet revive. The rest of Polkadot could interact with it synchronously via co-scheduling and co-integration, or asynchronously in the usual way via XCM. Non Polkadot systems could interact using a bridge. Coreplay is an idea at present; there is no writeup or lecture.  </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-12-21 23:10</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: It’s not exactly an upgrade for pallet-revive but it might provide an upgrade path for whatever systems are using it. We’ll have to see. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-12-21 23:11</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Taken at your definitions then yes it would be interacted with by everyday users.  <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

I&#x27;ll bet I&#x27;m not the only one who would like to see a lot of investment _beyond_ the JAM Prize into CorePlay, CoreVMs, JAM Services that make JAM something that everyday users can interact with.  But your relatively rare (and honestly, grinchy, to senior people anyway) vote/comment on 1317 brought a few questions to mind.   

Questions:
1. How should JAM services, tooling, and related innovations (minor or major) be supported outside the JAM Prize between OpenGov, the fellowship funds and outside capital?   Is there some ideal allocation between these sources (of capital) and sinks (talent doing xyz innovations) that you could articulate?   

2. Does a JAM-centric collective separate from the Fellowship make sense? Or does a 2025 revision to the 1.0/Substrate-centric fellowship charter to cover JAM + JAM Services (CoreChains/CorePlay/CoreVM), PolkaVM/revive/polkatool/JAM SDK, related tools to name last 18-24 months innovations make sense instead?  

3. Latent questions related to Rule 12:  What does it mean to be a fellow who knows JAM super well but knows nothing about Substrate?  What does it mean to be a fellow who knows Substrate super well but knows nothing about JAM?  

4. Can you provide guidance on how better decision making / resource allocation to JAM/CoreXYZ/PolkaVM innovation and support should come from the general public in OpenGov especially given that the knowledge required to reason about these things is either so new (say, JAM SDK) or requires a lot of expertise (say, the effort/innovation level in MMB over MMR)?  

I believe your guidance on these types of questions generally would be valuable for everyone who want to plot a course beyond JAM implementation life for next year and beyond.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2024-12-21 23:11</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: However I think those definitions are not especially helpful as they are so broad. </div>

<div class='msg'><time>2024-12-22 20:35</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: 4. I don’t see all that much need for JAM development from the “general public”. It’s a complex protocol not Roblox. </div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-01-04 04:36</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#db4fb3'>jakechen</span>: Hello, we are encountering an issue with header serialization. When the test data we use does not include epoch_mark and tickets_mark, we can correctly serialize the header data and compute the parent header hash for the next time slot using BLAKE2b-256. However, when the test data includes either epoch_mark or tickets_mark, the hash we calculate does not match the test data.
In addition to handling the discriminator encoding (Eq. C.9), does the serialization of epoch_mark and tickets_mark require any additional processing for the array data, such as epoch_mark.validators? 
We are troubleshooting using the test data files <a href="https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/blob/main/safrole/blocks/425530_000.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener">425530_000.json</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/blob/main/safrole/blocks/425530_001.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener">425530_001.json</a>.</div>

&gt; 
&gt; But here according to jam official codec it is just a hash:

The best way I see this of happening is to ask teams who have passed M1 to submit proposals for an SDK framework, giving code examples for the sort of thing their SDK would allow to write. I would then get some initial treasury funding of ~$100k, possibly just from the Fellowship Treasury. From the proposals, we could fund up to 10 teams ~$10k each to make initial prototypes of their proposals and 2 or 3 of the most promising prototypes could be further developed into proper SDKs. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Given that block-execution will likely take a very large portion of the 6 second block time, full-syncing a chain of any significance is going to be practically impossible, doubly so if you&#x27;re also having to retain a database of all inserted keys as well as everything else. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-01-19 17:41</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#db4dca'>celadari</span>: Hi everyone,

I have a question regarding the Safrole test vectors. Looking at this commit:

I noticed that the ring root values were changed, even for test vectors without offenders.

❓ Can someone clarify what changed at that point in the computation of the ring root?

At the moment, we are using the following code (this part is from primitives, so I can share it here in the thread)</div>

IIRC in that test you need to use the padding point twice: once for an invalid key and once for a key in the offenders list (which is zeroed out, so it becomes invalid as well). Are you using padding for both of these? IIUC you get a different ring commitment?

E.g. I was struggling with <code>safrole/tiny/publish-tickets-no-mark-9.json</code> and only now saw that its posterior gamma\_z changed from <code>0x95f3...</code> to <code>0xb375...</code> in the mentioned commit (<code>2d71c3f</code>) I think there are no offenders in this case but something in the computation of the ring commitment has changed. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

We believe this tool will serve as a living documentation resource even beyond the JAM Contest, supporting ongoing development and understanding of JAM.

To keep the Reader freely available and open-source, we’re **submitting a proposal for retroactive funding** to the Polkadot Treasury.

We’ve started a discussion on Polkassembly to share details about the proposal and gather feedback: <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/2722." target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/2722.</a> Your thoughts and questions are welcome!</div>

Yes indeed. Most test vectors will end up being useful for M1 but some are not relevant (such as erasure coding).

   * The <code>trap</code> exit status is now called <code>panic</code> to align with the GP.
   * Added new exit status: <code>page-fault</code>; tests which previously panicked when accessing unpaged memory now generate page faults.

All of the tests starting with <code>riscv_</code> are ported from an external RISC-V test suite, hence they&#x27;re named based on which original RISC-V instructions they were testing. I&#x27;ve just transpiled them to PVM (since PVM is derived from RISC-V) and left them mostly unmodified.

1.Why is the justification for a import segment is either a segment root hash OR a work package hash
2. Why is erasure root used to fetch segments and not the segment root? 
3.being given a wp from a builder, what is the process to find its erasure root? (seems that in order to know erasure root I need to know the imports and in order to do that I need to know the erasure root) <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-01-26 17:16</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: 2. Because the validators providing the segment shards can verify/prove to the erasure root but not the segment root</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-01-27 08:59</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Just a friendly reminder on clean-room requirements: don’t look at other implementation’s code (and that includes PolkaVM). Doing this will compromise you and your implementation. It’s not hard to see where code is copy-pasted (and use of the world’s most powerful plagiarism device, AI, is no different).

The rules are clear: if you submit a code base with content determined to come from anywhere other than official specs, you’ll likely be disqualified. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-01-27 10:18</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: To expand on what Gav wrote, in the context of PolkaVM (since that&#x27;s a major piece of Parity&#x27;s node implementation that is already open source and people may be tempted to look at) this should be obvious but let me explicitly state it - copying _any_ of these is not acceptable according to the rules (this list is _not_ exhaustive; these are just examples):

- PVM program blob deserialization
- instruction parsing
- interpreter implementation of what each instruction does
- exact interpreter architecture
- machine code which the recompiler generates for each instruction
- outer PVM memory map builder

It&#x27;s better to err on the side of caution and not look at PolkaVM at all, but there are some thing I would find acceptable to look at/copy/contribute to as long as it&#x27;s declared up front that you&#x27;ve looked at these things (note that this is not &quot;official&quot; and I&#x27;m only speaking in a purely personal capacity here, but I will defend anyone who does any of these):

- human readable disassembly pseudo code syntax (that is, the way instructions are printed out as seen in the TESTCASES.md in my PVM test vectors; there&#x27;s no official way to disassemble PVM programs besides what they&#x27;re named in the GP, but feel free to copy my pseudo code syntax if you like it),
- bindings to native Linux APIs (<code>polkavm-linux-raw</code> crate) and x86/AMD64 assembler (<code>polkavm-assembler</code> crate) - these are just general purpose libraries that only coincidentally live in the PolkaVM repository for convenience; the goal here is for people to become experts in the JAM protocol, and not become experts in how to write high performance x86 assemblers (which you need for a very fast recompiler, but by itself is not specific to the JAM protocol),
- high level API as shown on <a href="https://docs.rs/polkavm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://docs.rs/polkavm</a> (this is just an interface, not an implementation; even PolkaVM&#x27;s API was/is partially based on <code>wasmtime</code>&#x27;s API),
- high level techniques for implementing a fast parser or a recompiler, since it&#x27;s unrealistic to expect 34 independent teams to rediscover these from scratch, especially since those are useful/used when implementing _any_ VM, not just PVM (but I emphasize the _high level_ part - just copying PolkaVM&#x27;s code here is not acceptable; if there&#x27;s interest eventually I&#x27;ll host a workshop where I&#x27;ll explain some of these independent of any particular implementation),
- the toolchain to build PVM programs (<code>polkavm-linker</code> crate, <code>polkavm-derive</code>, <code>polkatool</code>, etc.) - this takes care of translating RISC-V code to PVM; this runs offline and is not part of the GP,
- the format of the <code>.polkavm</code> blob - the on-disk format of what the toolchain emits by default; this is not part of the GP and will never be (note that this only applies to the parts of the blob that are specific to the <code>.polkavm</code> blob and are _not_ specced by the GP!),
- the format of the debug info inside of <code>.polkavm</code> blob (is not and will never be specced by the GP; this is needed to be able to debug PVM programs and it&#x27;s useful for production-level VMs to support some form of debug info)

In general please use some common sense, and when in doubt please first ask. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Yes. It would most certainly and very obviously go beyond a single language set: your implementation is using two languages! <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-01-27 18:59</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#788ad5'>yu2c</span>: Got it, thanks for the clarification!</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-01-27 19:58</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#48d03d'>tomusdrw</span>: Correct me if my take on this is wrong, but my understanding is that the interpreter preformance is pretty irrelevant anyway, since to reach anywhere near the rust implementation (for m3/m4) it will require some transpilation of PVM code to native code (compilation).
I have a pretty limited knowledge on this, but afaict compilation involves: a) bringing in something that can turn assembler into native code (most likely llvm) and just producing native code for the hardware you are running on. For languages with runtimes it will require FFI anyway and the language-of-choice can only orchestrate that process.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-01-27 20:00</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: You don&#x27;t really want to use LLVM. Any implementation which uses LLVM would definitely not pass any of the performance tiers because JAM <em>requires</em> linear time O(n) recompilation (otherwise security of the network breaks) which LLVM cannot do.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-01-27 20:13</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: So there are essentially two major parts to a PVM recompiler VM implementation:

1) recompiler which will turn PVM into native machine code - technically can be done in <em>any</em> language, but will be too slow in some languages if we target performance anywhere close to what PolkaVM has; for some non-systems languages you might be able to pull it off if you use non-idiomatic code and carefully write it for performance, for some languages (Python, Ruby, etc.) it&#x27;s most likely completely impossible without using another language (maybe you could pull it off with some &quot;Python -&gt; C&quot; runtime/translator/whatever, but I&#x27;m not familiar with this space so I can&#x27;t tell)

2) interacting with low level OS APIs to &quot;load&quot; and run that code and manage the VM state (using hardware for detecting page faults, etc.); this for the most part will need at least some FFI, because the required APIs are very low level and a lot of languages can&#x27;t do this natively</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-01-28 07:05</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#bfaf39'>dakkk</span>: Anyway there are various techniques to improve performance even on interpreted languages; for instance, for me using python I can rewrite critical sections of jampy using cython (which is python code translated to C and compiled)</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-01-28 08:54</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: Take a look at benchmarks here:

<a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkavm/blob/master/BENCHMARKS.md#oneshot-execution-for-pinky" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/paritytech/polkavm/blob/master/BENCHMARKS.md#oneshot-execution-for-pinky</a>

Compare &quot;PolkaVM (64-bit, recompiler)&quot; vs &quot;PolkaVM (64-bit, interpreter)&quot;. My interpreter can still be optimized, but even if you look at state of art optimized-to-the-bone interpreters (e.g. wasm3) there&#x27;s still an order of magnitude performance difference vs the recompiler.

So essentially I expect the M3 performance threshold will most likely be on the level of &quot;a working but not necessarily optimal recompiler with okay compilation speed&quot; and M4 to be &quot;an optimized recompiler with high recompilation speed&quot;.</div>

I&#x27;m not really sure what there is to explain here as it should be pretty much self explanatory. The process of turning PVM into a native machine code needs to take O(n) time, that is the formula <code>recompilation_time = a * size_of_program + constant</code> must hold.

&gt; how we could get started on this process in the next 2 months?

Write a recompiler which turns PVM bytecode into machine code in a single pass (that is, you don&#x27;t go over the bytecode multiple times; you generate machine code as you read it), then write a VM that can load it and execute it.

&gt; It would appear that once we go through the above transformation, the bulk of our Appendix A PVM implementations are then expendable training wheels

No, you want to write an interpreter first simply because recompilers are so much harder to debug. If you have a correct interpreter you can then easily crosscheck your recompiler against it. Even I wouldn&#x27;t write a recompiler right off the bat and first make an interpreter.

&gt;  If this is correct, we should like to understand how this ecalli / host function call process works in a post-recompilation era, soon?

Sorry, I don&#x27;t understand this question at all. There&#x27;s nothing special about ecalli nor about calling host functions?</div>

Lets say the input to the function is: [a, b, nil, c]
I would expect the following behavior for this example:
- empty removed, giving [a, b, c]
- msg = $peak + a + b
- msg2 = $peak + H(msg) + c
- super_peak = H(msg2)
  
Does this seem like the correct flow (i reduced the details in the example, but can elaborate on steps if needed)? I&#x27;m not understanding where I am off in my logic here but like I said I am not outputting the correct value (unless its a bug elsewhere).

I just created a PR to jamtestvector, providing test vectors generated based on the definitions from the Gray Paper.

i just need to floor(22/4) - floor(6/4) = 4, which is greater than 1 rotation.

As you can see, since most of us can&#x27;t afford a JAM Toaster but can afford a few hours of <code>small</code> to <code>large</code>, or non-stop <code>tiny</code> to <code>small</code>, the simple-minded approach taken thus far is to have the same constants for <code>tiny</code> through <code>large</code> as <code>tiny</code>, and the same constants for xlarge through <code>full</code> as <code>full</code>.  If anyone has a better idea, just go for it!</div>

They may also be read and written by the owning service during accumulate. But services cannot synchronously interact in accumulate.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-11 14:02</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#ae40b7'>alice_und_bob</span>: lovely</div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-11 14:04</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#ae40b7'>alice_und_bob</span>: oh but so services could only compose synchronously if they have a trust-relationship?</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-11 14:05</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: It makes little sense to do synchronous composition without trust. </div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-11 14:06</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: You pretty much need to be able to trust that they&#x27;d do the thing you expect if you&#x27;re going to interact (directly) at all. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-11 14:07</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: For synchronous composition, you need two things: 1. to establish, in Refine, some causally-entangled effects. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-11 14:08</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: 2. To enact those effects within Accumulate if and only if you&#x27;re certain that the counter-party will, at some point, do the same. I call this the Integration Gate. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-11 14:10</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Generally I&#x27;d expect that causality to be established by co-scheduling within the same Work Package, since this way you&#x27;re more certain that they&#x27;ll both get to the Integration Gate. It also means that both Refines have access to exactly the same information. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-11 14:11</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: It could be done over multiple Work Packages, but then you&#x27;d need to extra logic to help establish what effect the Integration Gate should really be gating for (e.g. point 1 above). <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-11 14:12</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Point 2 will likely be done through each services send the other a <code>transfer</code> message establishing that they will certainly integrate their part of the entangled effects once they receive the same message from the other side.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-11 14:13</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: A simple way of identifying the entangled effects would be the hash of the work-package, which would easily fit inside the 64 bytes of the transfer memo. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-11 14:13</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#ae40b7'>alice_und_bob</span>: hm, and intuitively I would say it would create too much complexity to consider this for now</div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-11 14:14</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Well it&#x27;s inherently buildable on top of what we have, and I&#x27;ll probably try to write a simple service which shows it in action.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-11 14:15</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Unclear as yet. There&#x27;s a few possibilities.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-11 14:15</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: XCMP could be dropped and Hyperbridge used instead.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-11 14:16</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Or we could expand XCMP to a JAM-wide service and make it be able to deliver messages not just into the parachains service but also into CorePlay and whatever else. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-11 14:17</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Or we could keep it scoped as-is and potentially introduce another message-passing system specifically for inter-service messaging if it sufficiently desired.</div>

also, on receiving extrinsics from other nodes, we may need to fast validate the upcoming extrinsics otherwise the node hardly can author blocks successfully once there are invalid &amp; outdated extrinsics, besides, on waiting for finalization, we can preprocess the future extrinsics based on the predicted longest chain&#x27;s state <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

We are aware of a dozen pragmatic strategy choices we made (e.g. when and how often to send tickets, who to ask for D3L data in what order, whether to request/verify proofs when, etc.) but maybe there are 2 dozen others that we aren&#x27;t aware that we made but also could justify &quot;strategy&quot; specified in client implementation.  Potentially having non-GP strategy default choices could be useful, so that nodes don&#x27;t receive more tickets + requests + ...  than they actually need to from other implementations.  We could add a &quot;strategy&quot; component to docs.jamcha.in to make these 1-3 dozen strategy choices explicit and make it clear what it means to not only have a GP-compliant implementation but a &quot;friendly&quot; implementation (vs overly aggressive or overly conservative \[or lazy and maybe actually non-compliant \]). <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Most important aspects of strategy (e.g. extrinsic population, selection of WPs to guarantee) should be pretty straightforward to reason about optimal behaviour. We will likely, in due course, document strategies which we feel are sensible, and behaviour which we feel is crucial to deliver.

<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-14 15:27</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#a23bc7'>emielsebastiaan</span>: Gavin, 

In this new Parity blog (<a href="https://www.parity.io/blog/JAM-experience)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.parity.io/blog/JAM-experience)</a> the JAM Grid is mentioned. 

This Parity blog references an article explaining JAM Grid (by Permanence DAO: <a href="https://permanencedao.medium.com/jam-and-the-jam-grid-the-subsequent-phases-of-the-polkadot-cloud-a79f416e5ec5)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://permanencedao.medium.com/jam-and-the-jam-grid-the-subsequent-phases-of-the-polkadot-cloud-a79f416e5ec5).</a>

This referenced article seems to suggest that JAM Grid will have a shared security (by DOT).

1. Could you shed some light on this?
2. Do you envision JAMs in JAM Grid to have a shared security?
3. And if so, how would this (on a high level) be achieved technically?</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-14 15:33</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: This is still under ideation and there are still unsolved questions. However, the main strategy is to draw all JAMs’ validators from the same set, partitioning it randomly on each epoch.  <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-14 15:33</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: With enough validators, this can be shown to keep the majority of the security. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-14 15:35</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Eg two JAMs would have a single staking system which elected 2046 validators. Every epoch the two JAMs’ entropy would be combined to partition those validators randomly into two sets of 1023 and those validators would take over validating on their corresponding network. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-14 15:35</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Communication would be achieved between JAMs via the usual bilateral bridging. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-14 15:36</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Our bridge design is light enough and there’s enough processing power and data bandwidth that we can realistically afford to bridge every pair of JAM instances. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-14 15:37</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: The overall security in this model sits at 20% (rather than 33% as at present), which would lower the Nakamoto coefficient by around 40%. Not ideal, but Polkadot would remain well within its current practical security bracket.  <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-14 15:38</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: This model scales very well. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-14 15:39</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Even with 1000 JAMs and thus 1023,000 validators, we’d still enjoy a somewhat similar level of both security and coherence.  <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-14 15:40</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Exactly how similar is an open question. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-14 15:41</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: It is conceivable that a single service could be made to scale elastically over not simply one JAM’s worth of cores but many.  <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-14 15:41</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#a23bc7'>emielsebastiaan</span>: Thanks great!! This gives me something to ponder about. </div>

I think that the format adopted by <a href="https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/blob/main/data/safrole/state_transitions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jamduna</a> is quite practical (and is similar to the approach taken by <a href="https://github.com/javajamio/javajam-trace/tree/main/state_transitions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">javajam</a>).

Furthermore, could we explore defining community-wide values for the genesis header? For additional context, see these related issues:

The service. </div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-17 23:47</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#ae40b7'>alice_und_bob</span>: My understanding is that you can have work items from different services in one work package. 

Maybe a better way to phrase my question: how is the order determined in which work packages are processed?</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-18 01:40</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: &gt; &lt;@alice_und_bob:matrix.org&gt; My understanding is that you can have work items from different services in one work package. 
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe a better way to phrase my question: how is the order determined in which work packages are processed?

Work packages can declare a prerequisite work package. This will be enforced for accumulate ordering. Other than that, there are no ordering guarantees between WPs. Within the same WP, you get a guarantee that the different work items will execute contemporaneously. But if they are different services, they will execute independently; transfers are asynchronous and state-reads outside of the service which is executing are fixed at the state from when execution began. </div>

While we think that organising events which either support the implementers or wider reach of the technology, we are of the opinion that the budget and format of the event are not fitting. Regardless, we would still like to encourage you and even assist if necessary with planning a different type of event. 

Please find our reasons for rejection below: 

1. The Events Bounty is generally not in favour of standalone large events, as it is difficult to promote them and grow an audience. The location you choose would have also been proven difficult to attract further guests on the second day. 
2. We don’t see why you would be preparing devs for ETH Lisbon in a location outside of Lisbon, especially if the conference is centered around JAM. 
3. For this amount of attendees, the approximate agenda cost of the event is too high. 
4. It is expected that proponents use the attached budget sheet separately from the document so we can properly keep track of all entries. Every line item should be in USD, as well as the final price.  
5. We are not sure what “look and feel” entailed in the budget sheet. 
6. There is a full production team included in the budget, but it is not clear what the purposes of their roles are. Additionally, Adlib did not do the JAM Tour, nor the Grey Paper tour, this is done by Pala Labs and they are currently on the tour with Gavin. 
7. This event feels like multiple things: connecting implementers, sharing knowledge about JAM and preparing folks for ETH Lisbon. These are each an undertaking of their own, so we would propose organising only one of these formats. Additionally, aren&#x27;t there around 30 teams of implementers // cca 100 people? The events bounty would not fund all these travel costs. 
8. We know that the Palace is currently under construction and don’t know when it would be open for people to come and actually go there. 
9. If you would like assistance from us on how to format your event we would be happy to help.

- Transportation to Toaster (40 pax) Ext Travel €645.00

What else do you really really need over than the above.

The JAM0 in Bangkok was ~ $11-12K (sponsored by us) for ~5 days --  the above gets us 2 days for a similar price, and probably JAM teams can meet on the 6th or the 9th on their own to connect implementations.  I&#x27;d like to believe we can to real tiny=&gt;small stuff and have a Toaster summer plan by the end of this.

I&#x27;ve been amazed at how much we can quickly accomplish asynchronously with github given GP clarity, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one who believes that its in part because we&#x27;ve met each other IRL that we are able to accomplish this.  So lets be sure to make this happen.

If it doesn&#x27;t happen (sad!) [and also probably if it does], we can host a week at the end of the summer here in San Mateo California, though I imagine the total cost to all of you non-US people is way higher than just doing this type of event again in Europe. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-27 07:24</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: That&#x27;s not how it works. A proper recompiler (and a well written non-naive interpreter) won&#x27;t &quot;validate every time the instruction is called&quot;; it recompiles a piece of code once, and that&#x27;s it.

There are roughly two strategies you can have:

1) Recompile the whole program ahead of time.
2) Recompile parts of the program just-in-time as they&#x27;re executed.

Whether you reject programs with &quot;invalid&quot; bytecode (whichever way you define &quot;invalid&quot;) has absolutely no bearing on whether you can do (1), but it prevents you from being able to do (2).

So while we&#x27;re planning to essentially assume (1) in our gas cost model so far I&#x27;ve designed it so that the implementation has the flexibility to implement (2) and still be compliant (such an execution mode could be useful in certain cases, e.g. you have a huge program blob and you want to only execute a tiny chunk of it), and this means that you cannot require an O(n) pass to validate the program.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-27 07:56</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#825bc4'>jay_ztc</span>: Thanks for sharing your thoughts in such a detailed response Jan Bujak . The design background provides great clarity as well. I had in mind something similar to the 2nd approach, but combined with jmp table validations that could be done using the bitmask- lighter weight than parsing out the whole program up front. But I missed that the invalid target resolutions could be done as part of the JIT design as well. I&#x27;m leaning towards the opinion of leaving this flexibility as-is in the spec given your points, especially since this type of program bug should be something caught in the process of compiling into pvm bytecode anyways. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Would a rewards/cooling mechanic based on the &quot;tickets submitted&quot; activity stat come into play here? </div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-28 15:11</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: Do you mean Safrole tickets? There is possibly scope for this happening, but each validator can only produce 2 tickets per epoch, and the VRF output must be &quot;good enough&quot; to be included in the accumulator, so not sure this scope is very large</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-28 15:14</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#825bc4'>jay_ztc</span>: yep, was wondering if it might be a possible scenario for validator to drop any (or some percent of) peer tickets that have higher priority than their own <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-28 15:16</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: They could plausibly include the lowest value tickets possible, but at some point some other validator will probably include the higher value tickets so not sure it ultimately makes much difference</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-28 15:28</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: In the case where not enough tickets are accumulated, author selection falls back to a round-robin thing. This limits how much you can gain by censoring tickets</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-28 15:30</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#825bc4'>jay_ztc</span>: good callout on the fallback, yep. Probably some game theory equilibrium formula that&#x27;s of relevance here... Doesn&#x27;t sound like a big concern at present though. Thanks for sharing your thoughts.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-28 15:37</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: With 600-slot epochs, there could be an equilibrium where only 300 validators author blocks, and they refuse to include tickets for any other validators. Don&#x27;t know if this is a legitimate concern or not</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-28 15:38</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: 300 is obviously a lot, but it&#x27;s less than 1/3, which is the maximum number of byzantine validators for many other bits of JAM <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-28 15:41</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: There also wouldn&#x27;t be any real way of punishing this behaviour, outside of some governance thing</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-28 15:48</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#825bc4'>jay_ztc</span>: Sounds like a good use-case for a &quot;flexible-simulated-local-test-net&quot;; accelerate the protocol and spin up a mock test net to race through epochs as quick as possible and see if particular equilibriums are reached. Maybe a number of test nets in parallel and the results are aggregated/joined/interpreted in some way.Just thinking off top of head here... </div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-28 15:48</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#825bc4'>jay_ztc</span>: Probably some others here who have thought a bit about this already, in the context of the toaster </div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-28 15:49</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cb735c'>prasad-kumkar</span>: maybe we could multiply the tickets by eta1&#x27; before scoring? to bring even more randomness</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-28 15:49</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: Well this equilibrium will only happen with byzantine validators, which aren&#x27;t including all the tickets they receive</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-28 15:51</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: In general only including your own tickets would be a bad strategy as this would reduce your reward</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-28 15:52</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: It&#x27;s only a &quot;good&quot; strategy if you are colluding with many other validators to ensure you always get to author 2 blocks per epoch</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-28 15:58</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: My point being this kind of equilibrium will _never_ occur in a testnet where we&#x27;re only running honest validators</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-28 16:00</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#825bc4'>jay_ztc</span>: Yes. Worth calling out that is a pretty big assumption in that statement though-&gt; as far as parity between testnet and &quot;real world&quot;</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-02-28 16:02</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#825bc4'>jay_ztc</span>: hence, my thoughts went to not a &quot;true testnet with many parties&quot;, but rather a the &quot;flexible-simulated-local-test-net&quot; where behavior/equilibriums can be tested and reached quicker- given the input is &quot;node configurations across validators&quot; type of thing. Probably not putting it into text as cleanly as possible here...</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-28 16:02</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Even if 341 validators colluded and censored and didn’t include any tickets at all, that would only leave an expected 200 blocks per epoch without tickets. Even if those 200 tickets all fell in the first 500 blocks where tickets can be submitted, it leaves 300 normal blocks. With 8 tickets able to be introduced per block, there’s plenty enough room (8*300) for all the other legit validators to include all 600 winning tickets. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-28 16:03</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: There’s plenty of slack here. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-28 16:05</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: The point was if you are in a situation where there are 300 validators each producing 2 blocks in an epoch, they can just collude to include only their tickets for the next epoch, so no other validator ever gets a chance to author a block. Of course it might be practically impossible to get into this situation to start with</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-28 16:06</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Statistically speaking that wouldn’t happen.  <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-28 16:06</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Ever. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-28 16:08</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: The chance of there being only 300 block producing validators in an epoch is small enough. The chance of them happening to be the same 300 colluding out of the 1023 total is something magnificently small like (300/1023)^300 <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-28 16:10</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: It’s probably not quite that small (combinatorics being what it is) but I expect it’s vanishingly small regardless </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-28 16:11</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: And if you control literally every block in an epoch you could also block audits too. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-28 16:11</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: So you’d have a lot more to worry about. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-28 16:11</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: You probably don&#x27;t need to start with only 300 dishonest validators authoring, the dishonest validators could eg just fork to exclude blocks authored by other validators. Maybe even then it&#x27;s unlikely you could get a foothold, dunno</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-02-28 16:12</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: You’d need to control over half of the slots. </div>

Off-course we would love to have 1.0 ready by then, but this is just a wish. With 1.0 or not, the event will be awesome. Everybody is working hard, and milestone estimations don&#x27;t help to accelerate things.

Indeed they do not.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-02 05:03</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: I was going to prepare an implementors&#x27; update for JAMXP, but I may as well give the gist here.

The conditions for 0.9 are that we credibly expect to be able to run the Polkadot-compatible parachains service _and_ CorePlay at a speed which our best modelling implies. This is an art and not a science - don&#x27;t forget JAM is bleeding edge tech - so it will depend on the outcome of empirical experiments/analysis with the Toaster. I&#x27;d say this will probably (P&gt;0.5) happen by EOQ3. The GP will need to be audited; this I expect (P&gt;0.5) to take around 3 months and not to throw up too many issues. We may be able to audit implementations at the same time to shorten the TTL.

Regarding M1 submissions, my feeling is to get to 0.7 or 0.8, probably calling it in mid-April, and then open submissions for M1. Any milestone submission should be made for the most recent GP release at the time, this obviously includes submissions by teams who have already submitted for milestones on older GP versions.

Finally, I expect to introduce two additional paths for implementors to go down beyond the initial 5 milestones of the &quot;validating node&quot;:

- Non-PVM-recompiler validating node: This implementation allows teams who do not wish to build a recompiler to shortcut to M5 and thus become viable network validator nodes. Basically such teams would be able to integrate with any PVM recompiler of their choice through FFI or native linking. This would come at the cost of only being able to claim **HALF** of each milestone prize as well as accordingly less of some other benefits. Such teams would have the possibility of eventually resubmitting M4 and M5 with their own recompiling PVM impl to claim the rest of the prizes/benefits.
- Light-client implementations; these would retain M1 (dumb full node) but their own M2-M5 milestones each worth half of the regular prize, giving overall rewards at 60% of the regular recompiling, validating full-node. Milestones 2, 3 and 4 would be based on resource usage over time (CPU, storage, memory and networking) as well as synchronisation time from zero, partial synchronisation time and time to service a random basket of requests. No recompiler would be needed and resource usage expectations would likely be in line with Smoldot. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-02 05:06</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: None of this is decided yet and in particular we may need an incentive structure to avoid too many people switching to light-clients or getting too many low-power light-client implementations, but I do believe JAM will need a solid light-client community to be successful.</div>

I found that I have to author blocks on <code>forks</code> first otherwise the chain will never get finalized (tickets have distributed in nodes&#x27; own forks which won&#x27;t get finalized), while maintaining the state of fork may increase the complexity of state management significantly

or, have to produce ticket sealed blocks only and this is obvious incorrect according to the graypaper since it hardly can maintain the 6-secs timeslot of block production <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-10 16:18</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#825bc4'>jay_ztc</span>: Has documentation been released yet about the specific scope for M1 conformance? I&#x27;m curious what layer the testing will be at- since DA systems are out of scope for M1. Are there any specific APIs we should be conformant with, to make M1 acceptance testing across many implementations more streamlined?</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-10 19:28</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: Hello all, thanks for the invitation. I just want to clarify a few things. First off, I am a big fan of the enshrined-rollup centric architecture, I think monolithic scaling is a dead-end and a honeypot for centralized chains. I think JAM is an incredible innovation on the forefront of modular scalability (scalability without compromising L1 decentralization), and I think L1s as DA layers with minimal computation capacity (mainly for validating rollup state-commitments and fault proof resolution). That said, is JAM not what I am describing above? A state-of-the-art DA layer with a coherent data-sharing solution that addresses DA fragmentation. 

From my perspective, the goal is not to have all logic ran natively with the full security of the L1, it is to instead achieve scalability via enshrined rollups (in some sense equivalent to sharding) with fault proofs to inherit the full security of the L1 under the 1 honest live actor assumption. It is a mechanism for horizonal scalability. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 19:37</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd6fc8'>bkchr</span>: But JAM is not using fault proofs</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 19:37</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd6fc8'>bkchr</span>: It re-executes the candidates </div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 19:55</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: AFAIK, it re-executes the candidates with a subset of L1 validators (enshrined-rollup). The only way to inherit the full base layer security is by raising an issue (ie. fault proof).  <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 19:57</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd6fc8'>bkchr</span>: <a href="https://x.com/jeffburdges/status/1898690774704771498?s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://x.com/jeffburdges/status/1898690774704771498?s=19</a> did you read this answer? </div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:04</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: Yes, and again from what I understand JAM is still a base layer for enshrined rollups. I don&#x27;t argue against the degree to which those enshrined rollups inherit the base layer security. ELVES seems like a very sane design for rollups, with a very high degree of security inheritance, but at the end of the day there is still an objective difference in security between execution in a rollup and execution directly on the base layer with the security of the entire validator set. The difference in that security with respect to the enshrined rollups is a separate matter entirely, but it does exist.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:06</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: IE ELVES &amp; JAM are an improvement upon other rollup-centric architectures, and the post you have referenced explicitly mentions:

&gt; ELVES could be described as a twisted non-zk cut n choose roll up, which some shorten to pessimistic roll up.

Which again, furthers my understanding that indeed Doom executed on a rollup and not on the base layer. I don&#x27;t dispute the degree to which the rollup inherits the base layer security, but it doesn&#x27;t objectively inherit the full security of L1 validation. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:08</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd6fc8'>bkchr</span>: It is more likely that you get hit by meteoroid, but we still don&#x27;t assume that you already got hit :) You are saying because there is a chance that is smaller than getting hit by a meteoroid, the security is less than just running it as part of the state transition function of JAM.  </div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:11</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: Indeed, it is. There is a difference in security. I don&#x27;t argue that the difference is large, and relative to the scalability that is achieved I don&#x27;t argue that this is not a sensible choice, but at the end of the day, the computation is still executing on a rollup and settling to the L1 right? 

As stated: 
&gt;ELVES could be described as a twisted non-zk cut n choose roll up, which some shorten to pessimistic roll up.

It is even described as a rollup. I don&#x27;t disagree that the rollup inherits maximal security from the L1, but that don&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a rollup.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:12</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: Strictly speaking, from my perspective it is correct to say that Doom executed on a rollup. </div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:13</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: That rollup inherits maximal security from the L1, and probabilistically equivalent security, but this is not the same as executing natively on the L1.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:16</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: Originally, the only reason I even began this discussion is because someone posted:

and then went on to claim that Hydra Doom does not count because it was executed in a L2, and that on Polkadot it was executed on the base layer. </div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:17</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: To me this is an unfair claim. At the end of the day, both Hydra Doom and Doom on Polkadot executed in L2s, it is just that with JAM the degree to which the L2 inherits the L1 security is much higher. </div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:21</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: Agreed, but Hydra is a state channel, not a rollup, the goal of a state channel is for participants of the channel to inherit the full security of the L1 (because the computation is entirely irrelevant for non-participants). That means if you played in the Hydra Doom tournament (ie. were a participant in the Hydra Head) you have equivalent security guarantees of the L1.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:21</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd6fc8'>bkchr</span>: &gt; By providing more efficient means of processing transactions off-chain for a set of users</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:22</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd6fc8'>bkchr</span>: &gt; That means if you played in the Hydra Doom tournament (ie. were a participant in the Hydra Head) you have equivalent security guarantees of the L1.

<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:24</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: Hydra requires unanimous consensus amongst participants, so as a participant you will never willingly defraud yourself. </div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:26</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: I agree that enshrined-rollups are a more general purpose scaling solution, and that for adversarial cases the fact that it doesn&#x27;t require unanimous consensus amongst participants is obviously a massive strength.

<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:27</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: Personally, I think JAM&#x27;s enshrined rollups are much better L2s for 99% of task domains, but still they are both L2s. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:30</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd6fc8'>bkchr</span>: As I skimmed the paper it also requires that parties report to the main chain if someone closed a head on a wrong state. </div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:32</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd6fc8'>bkchr</span>: Also this tweet said:

&gt; Cardano recorded DOOM stats on chain

Which is correct, even from what you said above. (on chain doesn&#x27;t mean that the on chain was JAM itself and it is more the L2) </div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:32</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd6fc8'>bkchr</span>: But every L2 transition is checked by the JAM validators </div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:34</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: Closed a head on a previous state*

You cannot close a head on an invalid state because to initiate a close you need to provide the state snapshot that is unanimously signed by all participants, it&#x27;s just that the snapshot you provided might not be the most recent snapshot, and in that case others can begin a complaint processes which allows them to provide a more recent state (and the most recent state at the end of this process is considered canonical). </div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:34</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: Yes, that&#x27;s the only thing I wanted to clarify.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:35</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: Thank you for your time. I think JAM is a novel of engineering and a clear advancement in horizontal scalability in the blockchain domain as a whole.</div>

state channels are sooooooo far away from rollups though, and even further away from parachains, and even further away from JAM running DOOM on CoreVM. But sure.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:37</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#787fdf'>erin</span>: If you want to be pedantically correct yes, but if you want to be intellectually honest for the people you are speaking to then realistically no.</div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 20:39</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: Again, I am not arguing that Hydra is some amazing general purpose technology.

<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 21:01</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: Run the game in what sense? Cardano validators are not actors, they simply validate. On Cardano, a chess dApp for instance, takes the move (and the transaction inputs, outputs etc) as inputs, and returns true if the move is legal (and the resulting state is stored in a UTxO), or false if the move is illegal (and the transaction fails). 

In the case of Doom, the game state is stored in UTxOs, and when the player interacts with the game they are sending a transaction to replace that UTxO with a new updated game state and validating that the transition is honest. This ensures that if you play Hydra Doom as a participant, if you are hit by a bullet, it with reflect that in the game state UTxOs, and if you attempt to cheat by violating any of the game rules you will be unable to because your transaction would be rejected (and your character / health etc, will remain where it was prior to the transaction)  <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

In that case, no, the graphics rendering is not considered, it was only game logic and state that is executed in the Hydra head\*.  This ensured that if you play a hydra doom tournament, none of the participants can cheat, all players must obey the game rules (cannot do more damage than they are supposed to, cannot no-clip, cannot move faster or jump higher than the game logic allows, cannot avoid taking damage when they are supposed to, and so forth). <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Did Polkadot run Doom entirely on a rollup? As in the graphics engine rendering state was done entirely inside the rollup? How is the output rendered? If two players move, is it immediately reflected to both players? How is no-clipping / cheating handled?  <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 21:21</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: From what I gather the goal was different, the goal of Hydra Doom was to allow a multiplayer hydra tournament where the blockchain was used to ensure the integrity of the multiplayer tournament (all game logic is obeyed, and cheating is prevented).

From what I gather, JAM Doom was a compilation of Doom to Polkadot execution bytecode without modification? So for instance no-clips / cheating in general was not considered, as the goal was not about ensuring integrity, instead it was about showcasing the computation and bandwidth capacity of JAM services / enshrined rollups.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 21:24</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#a047cd'>jam_man</span>: from my understanding yes, all aspects of the game were run directly on JAM cores (or &quot;enshrined rollups&quot; as you keep calling them). where the game logic was split onto two parallel cores. where both cores were both processing the doom executable, and there was another process running monitoring the JAM chain and the JAM DA, this process was feeding frames out of the DA and displaying them in real-time. </div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 21:29</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: If this is the case, I am happy to write a revised statement on that, as in that case, JAM Doom directly executed the transpiled binary unmodified, where-as Hydra Doom reimplemented the game logic in smart contracts that validated the integrity of game state progression to ensure the security of the multiplayer tournament.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 21:31</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: That&#x27;s a very impressive showcase of bandwidth / computational capacity indeed.</div>

JAM services are different than rollups; they do not have to adhere to the properties of a blockchain. Polkadot parachains are only one such possible way to inherit this security, and thus services are something else entirely - they can be more generic than just running rollups as we know them.</div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 21:59</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: The smart contract logic was implemented by hand, not transpiled, because the Doom multiplayer code itself does not prevent no-clipping / speed hacks / most forms of cheating.

It is not optimistic nor is it fault proof based. It is checked every single state transition and this is how finality is reached so quickly on polkadot vs Ethereum.

So plausibly if you had spare processing power as a validator you could use it to check reports that you haven&#x27;t actually been assigned. I expect you wouldn&#x27;t receive any compensation for this so not sure it would be a great idea</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 23:04</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: I see. The solution in other rollup-centric ecosystems is that the publisher of a state commitment must be bonded (ie. have slashable value locked) and if a third party (not even necessarily validator) decides to review state commitments of a given rollup and detects fraud and submits a successful fraud proof then the publisher of that state commitment has their bond slashed and the party who successfully submitted the fault proof receives a portion of it as a reward.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 23:05</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: I guess in the above case, you could reward the validator (with spare compute who decided to review the incoming state commitment associated with a rollup that they were particularly interested in) with a portion of the bond only if fraud indeed did occur and the audit committee did not report it (very low chance).</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 23:07</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#348dc3'>philipdisarro</span>: A lot of the time though, third parties (non-validators) will likely be reviewing the state commitments of a given rollup anyway for a myriad of reasons (ie. they are an indexer, or web-based blockchain explorer, or dApp, or otherwise running any service that depends on monitoring the state of that rollup).</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 23:09</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: In JAM validators are both the &quot;publishers of state commitments&quot; _and_ the parties responsible for reviewing these. When acting as publishers we call them guarantors and when acting as reviewers we call them auditors, but they are the same actors. Validators in practice will be slashable, for misbehaviour in either role</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-10 23:10</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: I say &quot;in practice&quot; because slashing is not really part of JAM itself but will be managed by a service running on JAM</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-11 10:51</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Well, the point that Elves brings is bounded security.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-11 10:55</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Because there only needs to be one honest auditor to raise a dispute, because the fork-choice and finality subsystems are explicitly tied into the disputes mechanism, and because Elves is able to properly reason about the chances that each and every work-report of a block (roll-up state-delta commitment) has been audited by at least one such validator, we are able to reach a statistical certainty (within economic bounds, as with all crypto-economic systems) over the correctness of any given block&#x27;s state-transition fast and ensure that any finalised chain contains only correct state-changes. And we can do this without forcing all validators to compute everything. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-11 10:58</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: &quot;Fast&quot; here means generally within 10 seconds after the work was initially done. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-11 11:00</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: As Dave says, this only works because it&#x27;s all happening within a closed network of validators whose behaviour we can reason about and thus can actually model these probabilities correctly.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-11 11:09</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: &gt; From my perspective, the goal is not to have all logic ran natively with the full security of the L1

This very much depends on what is meant by &quot;full security&quot;. I would argue there&#x27;s not really a useful way of reasoning about this. The security of an L1, any L1, is not insurmountable. Like all crypto-economic systems, the best we can do is measure _the cost_ of breaking it. And there are multiple ways to break a system (censorship, stalling, reversion, invalid state transition, to name just four). The costs of breaking each of these are typically different and change between L1s and over the course of time of an L1. So the concept of inheriting any particular aspect of any particular L1&#x27;s security guarantees at any particular time is pretty much meaningless. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-11 11:09</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: What is meaningful is to be able to state the actual cost of breaking a system, in what way, and with what assumptions.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-11 11:17</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: In any case, Elves is specifically designed not only to construe the security of the L1 to ensure correctness of co-processing units, but also to ensure that those who attempt to thwart it are heavily punished. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-12 22:32</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#817ecb'>ycc3741</span>: I’m very curious about how JAM runs DOOM without delay.
What I mean is that JAM itself has a six-second finalization time.
So my inputs go through:
Input (mouse or keyboard) → corevm → JAM → corevm → Output (monitor)
Logically, wouldn’t that result in a six-second delay?</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-03-12 22:40</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: My guess is that the DOOM demo has the &quot;user&quot; computing the work packages FIRST (and as a result, knowing the exact exportCount), and then what you see in the demo is the stream of work packages submitted by the user into a core (or some number of them), the &quot;frames&quot; going through DA, and the claim that &quot;JAM is running DOOM&quot; is actually &quot;JAM is doing guaranteeing/assuring/auditing AFTER the user has submitted their work package&quot; -- its a streaming demo and a test of N cores doing (a) DA throughput (of the &quot;frames&quot;) (b) the same computational process in refine that the user.  So, no jerkiness, but yes, a 6-12 second delay technically between what the user has done in creating N exported segments (representing video frames) and polkavm replicating the same computation.

Just a guess, hope someone can correct it </div>

Probably more than a 6-second delay; the Work Package must first be computed, sent to a guarantor; two of them must then compute the work-report and send it to the author; they must then place the report in the block and accumulate it. At peak usage the pipeline will normally take somewhere around 12-18 seconds, though if refinement is very fast, you have core affinity, you get lucky on the block phase and there&#x27;s not much to accumulate, it could be less than a second. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Wouldn&#x27;t it be great to enable this kind of development?

It is a tradeoff - with a WASM -&gt; PVM recompiler you could use existing WASI backends, but you&#x27;d get more bloated binaries and worse performance; with a libc port you&#x27;d have to reconfigure each compiler to use it (which is extra work, although it&#x27;s relatively easy to do) but you&#x27;d get higher performance and smaller binaries.</div>

Great idea to use risc-v hardware. The Core Jam Pi could be a cluster of 3 Raspberry Pi 5s  16 GB RAM model, each with its own 1TB NVME SSD. Each would function as a validator. What do you think?</div>

I found that for only storing headers &amp; communicating with neighbours, we may miss sort of blocks when are about to author blocks (in tiny network, 3 of the neighours only have the headers, they may do best chain selection later then, but when they get the expected block the current node may have already authored a new block), and then, fork occurs even in my local testnet ))

If you need to write a bunch of boilerplate code that was already done a million times - that&#x27;s where using an LLM shines, but if you&#x27;re doing novel work it&#x27;s either going to sabotage you because the code will just plainly be wrong, or waste a bunch of your time because you&#x27;ll have to rewrite it anyway. Not sure if Gav would agree, but personally I wouldn&#x27;t care if you&#x27;d use AI to help you write some boilerplate unrelated to JAM (e.g. spinning up an RPC server in your language of choice; that has been done a million times already and I see no reason to waste time reinventing it yet again - without an LLM you&#x27;d copy-paste it from the library&#x27;s docs or StackOverflow anyway) or get it to generate some unit tests for you, but everything related to the protocol itself and its implementation should be written entirely manually. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Based on the submission rules &amp; milestone delivery repo, completing m1 doesn&#x27;t &quot;reserve your spot&quot; for future milestones. Currently there is (up to) 100k dot per milestone and 2.5 mil dot per lang pool. It could be the case that 10 teams for a single pool complete &amp; collect m1 and m2 payments- meaning 20x100k dot has been paid out (75% of it linearly vesting). In that case there would only be 500k left in that prize pool.

People do mock blockchains for not having any use cases except maybe cryptocurrency. The reason for success of cryptocurrencies and what made them different is there is a singular verifiable database, not millions of small databases for each bank that require and trust third-party solutions like SWIFT to securely transfer information between these databases.

But that&#x27;s only one type of data being transferred daily - health care records, educational records, financial records, property deeds, and million other fucking important records that are still broken up in these mini databases. 

All these Important information is still fragmented, still requiring trust on these third party solutions.

Companies have been trying to build private blockchains for this, but their problem is the same - they are private, most of them are not more than a few nodes of the same company in different locations. They are not secure; an attack on just few nodes not only bring the whole network down but also compromise the integrity of all the data.

JAM is what they need. JAM is what will allow all these private blockchains to be secure and interconnected. These private blockchains could remain private and borrow the security guarantees from JAM by using ZK proofs or maybe some other tech. Even if some company nodes get compromised, it will only make the data of that specific company public but not have any affect on the integrity of the data 

I believe this is what required next.

<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-26 22:59</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: Thank you for clarifying -- We are currently using the segment root lookup within the work report to actually verify the justifications within the bundle and understand the segment root lookup piece of the work report to be absolutely critical to auditing.  If that&#x27;s wrong, we&#x27;d appreciate being corrected as we think we have all the pieces fitting together finally.

In particular, we put some &quot;guarantee test data&quot; together in a new <a href="https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/tree/0.6.4.0/guarantees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">0.6.4.0 guarantees dataset</a>, where we believe we have both generated and verified the self-justifying bundle exactly in the above audit situation.

I wrote up a doc on what we think implementers should do with this <a href="https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/issues/139" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guarantees dataset here</a> and hope we + others can slog through the heart of this central &quot;puzzle&quot; together soon.

Earlier I was concerned about implementers coding to the test vectors and didn&#x27;t want to share this kind of writeup (and give away the wrong puzzle answer, and superspread a JAM &quot;mental disease&quot;, so to speak, in addition to taking away the delights of solving your puzzle in the first place), but _this_ puzzle is so layered and from our month on getting <a href="https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/releases/tag/0.6.2.12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">0.6.2.x alignment</a>, I&#x27;ve concluded implementers are so independent and puzzle-solving oriented that I&#x27;m not concerned anymore:  instead, I&#x27;m seeing lots of independent implementations against the same GP produce the anti-fragility you aimed for.

However, if you are concerned, I&#x27;d appreciate what you think we should to do to modulate our collective activity a bit. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-27 12:32</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4977cf'>danicuki</span>: Hi jammers, we are trying to set up a booth at  ETHLisbon to present JAM to event devs. We need a few volunteers to stay there during ETH Lisbon dates (9th-11th). LMK if you want to help</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-03-28 12:59</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#3e9d41'>stsoen</span>: ​Actually, it makes sense. Moreover, if we look at the current Rollup Landscape, it appears as a patchwork quilt of different pieces. And the quilt is made not only of fabric but also of other materials that may be poorly compatible with each other. In most cases, there is no idea for existence other than &quot;we made it, come here.&quot;​

JAM, on the other hand, offers a unified approach with reasonable modularity. Instead of immediately creating something complex with a large number of features unnecessary for most users, instances can be made more targeted for specific cases.​

And this applies not only to cases for companies and enterprises but also to more global and widespread things such as payment systems, data verification, creating common economic layers for a series of games or games from one studio. This also includes cases similar to Hyperliquid, and so on.​

At the same time, unlike AVS (Networks, and so on in different protocols) for restaking, which is actually properly developed only in EigenLayer, there is no need for an extra layer of &quot;restaking.&quot; Moreover, the idea of restaking over the long term seems somewhat questionable because economically it does not work as expected.​

And JAM looks like something that is in superposition relative to all these options: it does not have the disadvantages of the above options but at the same time possesses their advantages.</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-03 15:28</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#be2950'>clearloop</span>: curious about how do you like your PVM interfaces so for? after following the invocation interfaces strictly, my PVM interpreter turns into functional style finally, it&#x27;s cool but the function signatures just have too many arguments, I&#x27;m thinking of that we may need more composed types defined in GP for the PVM part</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-03 15:48</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: Do you want to know how my interfaces look like, or are you looking for suggestions? :P If so I&#x27;d probably suggest a traditional fetch + eval interpreter loop at a bare minimum, plus a stateful interface to control it. The GP isn&#x27;t really an implementer&#x27;s guide and its equations have no bearing on how something should _actually_ be implemented; sure, you can translate its equations directly into code, but you&#x27;ll be killing your performance by doing that, so for any non-toy implementations I&#x27;d probably suggest not to do that (especially for PVM, where you can make your situation potentially orders of magnitude worse even compared to a basic straighforward traditional interpreter design). :P <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-03 16:02</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#be2950'>clearloop</span>: while considering supporting both interpreter and re-compiler in the same interface, we have an abstraction layer for PVM interfaces ( also it is caused by the design of our runtime, things like PVM, validator, storage, and even the network implementation are modular ), so I&#x27;d like to confirm if the PVM interfaces in the GP has already been the standard, if so, I&#x27;ll keep following it atm, otherwise my hands are not tied</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-03 16:09</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: The GP doesn&#x27;t define any PVM interfaces in the sense of an interface in a programming language; again, it describes the visible <em>behavior</em> of a JAM implementation, but doesn&#x27;t specifically require <em>how</em> that behavior should be achieved. There&#x27;s no standard PVM interface, and even if there were one it&#x27;d most likely look very very different than what the equations in the GP suggest, assuming its intended use would be as an abstraction layer over multiple PVM implementations for a production JAM node.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-03 16:17</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: If you want some inspiration on how to structure your interfaces I&#x27;d suggest to look at some of the production VMs out there and see how they do it.

For example, some of the WASM VMs:

wasmtime - <a href="https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/</a>
wasmi - <a href="https://docs.rs/wasmi/latest/wasmi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://docs.rs/wasmi/latest/wasmi/</a>
wazero - <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tetratelabs/wazero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tetratelabs/wazero</a>

Or even just look at my interfaces:

<a href="https://docs.rs/polkavm/latest/polkavm/struct.Module.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://docs.rs/polkavm/latest/polkavm/struct.Module.html</a>
<a href="https://docs.rs/polkavm/latest/polkavm/struct.RawInstance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://docs.rs/polkavm/latest/polkavm/struct.RawInstance.html</a>

(Feel free to copy them if you want; it&#x27;s just an interface, and I wouldn&#x27;t consider it collusion or plagiarism - there isn&#x27;t really anything super JAM specific in there, and all of it is fairly straightforward if you have any experience with working with VMs.)</div>

&gt; The only issue I see with this particular encoding is that it&#x27;s neither var-len sequence nor fixed-len sequence (we don&#x27;t know the length upfront) as specified in GP, but rather a concatenation of block encodings.

That’s a regular sequence encoding as specified in the GP. </div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-04-04 19:40</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#48d03d'>tomusdrw</span>: Sure, it is, but the receiver does not know how many elements is there.
From that perspective a variable-length sequence encoding (with a length discriminator) is not needed at all.
Obviously there is a much better-defined boundary of the items in sequence (end of the byte stream vs not-matching encoding), but still I&#x27;d argue that this kind of usage of fixed-length encoding is rather a peculiar case. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-04 18:46</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: GP requires the double-end-vertical-arrow prefix notation in order to prepend a length. GP doesn’t state that it <em>must</em> be used when the sequence length may not be static, and indeed there are instances (like hashing) where it may reasonably be omitted even if the sequence is of variable length. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-04 18:47</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Streaming, or decoding from a known size container, would be other such instances. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-04 20:26</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Again would not be correct to call it a “fixed length encoding”.  <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-04 20:26</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: It’s  just not prefixed with the number of elements. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-04 20:27</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: So most of the time the length prefix will be used when there isn’t a fixed number of elements but correlation is not equivalence. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-04 20:28</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: As for the wisdom of prefixing with the sequence length or not in this case, I agree it is arguable. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-04 20:29</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: But it’d be wrong to characterise it as literally incorrect on the mistaken basis that the length prefix strictly <em>implies and is implied by</em> the condition of the underlying data being defined as have a fixed length.  <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-04 20:33</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: There are already multiple instances in the GP where sequence term with non-fixed length is encoded without the length prefix.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-04 20:35</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: And on a more general note, the GP doesn’t use any kind of formal typing; 42 is 42 whether it is in N_{256} or N_{2^32}. With this set theoretic syntax it is not actually possible to reason about whether the data is fixed or variable length from the perspective of the value itself. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-04 20:36</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: So it’s best to use terminology that reflects the formalism. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-07 10:59</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#a23bc7'>emielsebastiaan</span>: Hello all,

I&#x27;d like to kick off a little discussion we had internally in our team meeting recently regarding our collective approach in working towards a public testnet.
Last October in Bangkok those attending JAM0 have initiated an initiative to converge towards a community testnet, called the JAMduna Testnet.
Me and my team believe this is an admirable objective, however we have some worries about potential conflicts with the JAM-prize rules, that may warrent discussion and ideally clarification from W3F and/or Gavin.

The official rules state the following: 
- Rule 6: &quot;Clean-room implementation using the Graypaper and public implementers&#x27; channel as the only resources.&quot;
- Rule 8: &quot;Relevant private (not in the public implementers&#x27; channel) conversations with other implementers must be declared and summarised in reports to the Fellowship.&quot;
- Rule 18: &quot;Implementations must pass all relevant public and private conformance/performance tests. These will be shared in the near future.&quot;

Gav&#x27;s Unofficial notes add to rule 6:
- Additional materials may be added here at a later stage.

What we like about the Testnet:
- We believe some coordination is absolutely necessary in order to get to the minimum necessary agreement on practical testnet setups.
- Coordination towards a testnet in our opinion is no different than coordination around the W3F Test Vectors. Like the community findings of W3F Test Vectors, the community findings in the testnet repo lead to higher quality implementations, findings of errors and ambiguities in Graypaper and findings of errors in the W3F Testvectors.

What we are concerned about with the Testnet
- Discussions and thus coordination activities are increasingly happening on other channels like Telegram and Discord (read: NOT the public implementers&#x27; channel on Matrix). These channels are arguably public since they were once referenced on the Matrix channels, but these are separate channels that could potentially unlevel the playing field or create an entry barrier.
- Rule 6 and 18 do not explicitly state the Testnet resources to be accepted as a source of coordination (as for the W3F Testvectors for the record).
- Obviously any resource outside Graypaper allows for potential blindspots to emerge (collective misinterpretations). There is however a trade-off to be made here.

Questions we have:
- Is there a risk of JAM-price penalty when a team collaborates on the initiative towards a public testnet?
- Can we classify the JAMDUNA testnet repository in the same category as the W3F Testvectors? And perhaps add this to the (unofficial) rules (&quot;Additional materials may be added here at a later stage&quot;). Or agree on what needs to happen to make this so.
- Can we agree on some do&#x27;s and dont&#x27;s in working towards the testnet?

Let&#x27;s use this thread to have a discussion about this.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-07 12:22</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: The rules are there for a reason. Disregarding them, in particular with setting up additional semi-private, invitation only or even merely difficult to discover channels for teams to exchange notes and ideas would endanger those teams ability to claim the prize. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-07 13:01</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#a23bc7'>emielsebastiaan</span>: Thank you. Nothing new here, but this strengthens our concern regarding the additional channels.
We are of the opinion that participating in Telegram and Discord channels might not be smart (free advice) when discussing findings, GP-ambiguities, and similar things.

Follow-up question I have:
1. Are current W3F Test Vectors considered public conformance tests? These have proven to be a source of finding Graypaper mistakes and ambiguities.
2. Can JAMDUNA testnet traces (<a href="https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet)</a> be considered public conformance tests equally? These have proven to be a source of finding Graypaper mistakes and ambiguities.
3. Can JAM-Docs (<a href="https://github.com/jambrains/jam-docs)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/jambrains/jam-docs)</a> be considered a public resource for JAM Implementor teams?

When considering (2) and (3) these in contrast to (1) are not listed in the Resources section on Graypaper.com.
There is a collective payoff in these initiatives (better graypaper) and individual payoff (additional source of finding mistakes in your implementation).

4. IMO it would be smart to keep a good accounting record of the list of things your team got from these unofficial resources and the list of things your team contributed to the community due to these unofficial resources.

5. Is working towards to public testnet (JAMDUNA initiative) in its core an activity that might conflict with JAM Prize rules?</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-07 13:16</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: With regards to a testnet, it’s a little complicated. In principle I think it is admirable and wonderful to see teams so keen on pushing things forward. It’s a good “problem”to have. But indeed it could be a problem. My main concern is over the accessibility of such a network - there are perverse incentives because of the (regrettably necessary) first come first serve nature of the prize. A secondary concern is that those partaking in it may inadvertently get extra “knowledge” over conventions and customs which others do not. This is exasperated by communications happening outside of the two official channels. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-07 13:16</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: 1. Yes, this is the aim. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-07 13:18</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: 2. Feel free to report GP ambiguities or clarification questions that arise from this. Feel very free to publish them.  They cannot be considered official requirements though as there is no W3F review process in place. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-07 13:19</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: 3. No it cannot. It may very be a helpful resource but only the GP is official for the JAM prize. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-07 13:20</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Even JIPs/RFCs are unofficial conventions until/unless they move or are referenced by the GP. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-07 13:21</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: 5. Potentially yes. </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-07 13:23</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#a23bc7'>emielsebastiaan</span>: I get your concern about a public testnet, which given your statement may not be smart to pursue.
That said, so far no such public testnet exists only coordination on how such testnet could be set up. 
Is this where a line should be drawn? 

One interesting snippet from my team meeting:
Team member: Gavin&#x27;s team was looking at the JAMDUNA testnet repository. So it is okay.
My paranoid response: Gavin&#x27;s team might not be pursuing JAM Prize payout.
</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-07 13:23</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: In so much as conformance to an unofficial testnet has no direct relevance to the GP and thus could be considered either a distraction or outright dangerous for consensus (by forming sub-dialects of the protocol). </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-07 13:23</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Well, naturally I’m interested to see!</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-07 13:25</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: But the purpose of the prize is to maximise team independence and expertise. To the extent that an unofficial testnet works in favour of this, I’m in favour. But it’s a judgement call, and ultimately i believe it possible for teams to cross the line in pursuit of <em>their</em> consensus. Resulting in a case of structurally reduced consensus among JAM impls as a whole.  <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-07 13:27</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: I think provided the testnet is 100% open, zero-barrier and responsible to W3F/Fellowship it’ll be fine.</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-07 13:44</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Without making any promises, I’d say that outside of the get-togethers, 0.7.0 would be the time to start a persistent, open access, public testnet. It will likely need to be reset on subsequent GP releases (with an appropriate delay to give teams a chance to catch up to any changes).</div>

So far, there is nothing much in the way of teams actually connecting to each other
<a href="https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/issues/69" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/issues/69</a>
Last week was the only connection we made, with the primary discovery that we had to lowercase our SAN, and that we needed to address CE128 multiblock responses.  These conversations can definitely be 100x noisy and require a &quot;did you get header hash 0x4e37...&quot; type level real time communication pattern -- WAY too noisy for a room with several hundred people and I think, a few dozen teams in a &quot;jamtestnet&quot; room, whether for the toaster or just for 2 teams to figure out wire format bugs and QUIC connectivity.   

So far the &quot;jamtestnet&quot; is a total misnomer -- more accurately it can be called &quot;importblocksalignment&quot; but, with a half dozen having achieved that alignment, its possible to achieve real &quot;accumulate-side&quot; testnet alignment, with actual import blocks happening from genesis onwards!

From <a href="https://github.com/jam-duna/jamtestnet/issues/69" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> there are actually only a few teams actually both wanting and ready to participate in a testnet.  Given the &quot;the testnet is 100% open, zero-barrier&quot; requirement, we can quell any &quot;could you make this a little less noisy&quot; type complaints by doing all this testnet work in a public room.  Does it matter if its Discord, Telegram or Matrix?  Or should we just shut down the jamduna/jamtestnet repo and wait for the Toaster? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

&gt; Note that blocks directly contain only the hashes of included work-reports and preimages. If unknown, the actual work-reports and preimages should be requested using protocols 136 and 143 respectively.

and

&gt; Block = As in GP

but blocks defined in GP already contains the work report and preimages, not just the hashes of them?</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-04-09 08:52</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: Yeah I think this and/or the GP needs updating. Blocks requested via CE128 are not intended to include reports/preimages. The idea is that the vast majority of the size of a block will be reports, and in practice these are distributed to all validators in advance, so it&#x27;s a waste of time and bandwidth to distribute them again with new blocks</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-04-09 08:54</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4cbfa8'>xlchen</span>: I see. So is not <code>As in GP</code> at current version. It will be a LightBlock or something that the preimages and work reports will be replaced by a hash?</div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-04-09 09:30</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: Full block for now is reasonable. It&#x27;s effectively what is specified and is what eg Polkajam is currently doing. I&#x27;ll remove this wording that implies light blocks for now.

It appears natural to chart light client implementation plans first without GRANDPA and then with. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-13 13:37</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: Instead of adapting &quot;7.4.4 Remote Read Messages&quot;, I suggest a more proactive jip-2 method <code>subscribeBlock(withJustifications=true)</code> explicitly designed for light client verification that returns _all_ the storage value justifications needed to actually reexecute a JAM state transition.

Full node implementations responsive to light clients <code>subscribeBlock(withJustifications=true)</code> must track all storage values that are read from state trie and provide justifications of:
(a) pre-state C1-C15 that are actually read
(b) pre-state storage keys/values (including preimages + lookup) accessed via  host function calls: <code>read</code>, <code>lookup</code>, <code>solicit</code>, <code>forget</code>, <code>info</code>, <code>eject</code>, <code>query</code>, <code>transfer</code>, ...
(c) code in preimages referenced in all ordered accumulation

Light clients can verify all storage value justifications (a)-(c) (or some subset of them), then reexecute ordered accumulation (including PVM using verified code of (c)) just like full nodes do, and if they derive the same state root, the light client considers the individual JAM state transition valid.

To preserve &quot;7.4.4 Remote Read Messages&quot; JAM equivalent so that the light client just requests justifications for _some_ of the pre-state storage keys/values, presumably to not have a lot of bandwidth used up for justifications, then we would still want some parameter input of <code>subscribeBlock</code> enable returning _all_ the storage keys+values read in the state transition.

What else is needed?

All of this can be done without GRANDPA and warp syncing in one half of implementation, and then with.  Does that make sense? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-04-13 22:30</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: Maybe I&#x27;m not understanding but light clients shouldn&#x27;t need to execute blocks or even need to fetch enough state to be able to do this. I understand you want to get something working without GRANDPA but that can be done by simply having the light client trust finality without verifying.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-04-13 22:35</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: Light clients will use the JAM network protocol (SNP or its successor). The RPC interface is really only intended to be used to connect to locally running nodes. This is for example to make it easy to write tools; instead of incorporating a node tools can just use the RPC interface of a standalone node. Long term it&#x27;s possible that these tools will just incorporate a light client. In any case I think light client and RPC are probably mutually exclusive things.</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-04-13 22:41</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: Of course SNP as it stands is not suitable for light clients.

<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-04-13 22:46</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4cbfa8'>xlchen</span>: speaking of extensions, it will be great if SNP support some basic implementation name / version discovery so that we can have some feature discovery / telemetry ability</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-04-13 22:53</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c65779'>dave</span>: You can use QUIC/TLS ALPN for this. Obviously that&#x27;s not going to work very well if there are many extensions, don&#x27;t think we really want to get to that point though</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-04-13 22:56</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4cbfa8'>xlchen</span>: my main goal is know which implementation/version is the other side running. this can be helpful to for example workaround some bug in some legacy version or know where to report bugs if found out the other side is sending bad data</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-04-14 07:47</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Then ALPN should be fine, no?</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-04-14 07:50</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4cbfa8'>xlchen</span>: unless I missed something, ALPN is for protocol version negotiation, how can we use it to discovery the implementation version of peers? <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-04-14 08:10</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Yeah then we can try to introduce this to JAM SNP.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-13 19:40</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4977cf'>danicuki</span>: &gt; &lt;@charliewinston14:matrix.org&gt; I hope that you can record this and share online (or publish live) as not all teams have the funding to fly to portugal.

All content will be recorded and shared </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 00:13</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: Hmm, for &quot;shouldn&#x27;t need to execute blocks or even need to fetch enough state to be able to do this&quot; I think we should get on the same page about what a JAM light client should be.   I thought light clients re-execute the minimal state transition logic but _without having to store anything or process every state transition_ -- this means they need to get storage proofs, verify these storage proofs, and verify recent headers ( including the state root which requires doing PVM accumulation, and ordered accumulation at that ), in order to be a _trustless_ light client.   There is surely some &#x27;I&#x27;m actually only interested in _my_ services&#x27; smarter approach to verifying the storage proofs, but to verify the state root it appears essential to do the PVM accumulation.

Light clients:

- download **and verify** block headers to stay in sync with the chain’s head. This includes the state root, which requires doing ordered accumulation, including PVM.
- verify that blocks have been finalized (which are GRANDPA finality proofs in both Polkadot+JAM).  I assume the last 28 days will be warp synced
- request storage proofs needed to validate a transition, which is/was the purpose of 7.4.4.

If you have low-powered light clients they can choose to pick some _subset_ of storage proofs (e.g. in a self-centered way, biased to just the services the light client cares about) for reduced security, but as you go from verifying all to verifying nothing, you go from &quot;trustless&quot; light client to &quot;trust me bro, I&#x27;m infura&quot; light client.

CE129 could be adjusted to fill the role of 7.4.4 but as of this moment it doesn&#x27;t return Justifications and is optimized for range queries.  Another CE could be created for light clients to get storage proofs, but there still needs to be a source of which state trie keys have been read. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 07:49</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: They do no re-execution of on-chain logic. Theoretically they could but it&#x27;s super-cumbersome and it is not generally what is meant by &quot;light-client&quot;.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 07:50</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Instead, they accept proofs of on-chain state through the (prior) state-root found in the header.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 07:50</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: They trust this header/state-root because of the GRANDPA finality proof. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

No.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 07:51</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: You&#x27;ve totally missed the whole point of JAM/Polkadot&#x27;s finality. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 07:53</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: The point of finality is not merely to avoid reversion. It is also to place economic weight behind _correctness_. With our assumption of no more than 1/3 malicious nodes, GRANDPA will only finalize valid transitions, _including in-core logic_. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 07:54</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: This means that trusting in GRANDPA gets a similar degree of security to trusting &quot;JAM&quot; more generally.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 07:56</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Now, of course, this is not (quite) as high a confidence level as actually executing everything yourself. But then this isn&#x27;t practically viable anyway on a system as scalable as JAM/Polkadot firstly as the in-core computation has extrinsic data which is not made indefinitely available (e.g. parachain transactions in Polkadot&#x27;s case); and secondly you&#x27;d need near Toaster-level hardware to re-execute all of the work-packages going through every core. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 07:57</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: But this idea of (re-)executing everything in order to gain confidence in correctness is a Bitcoin mind virus.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 07:58</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: It&#x27;s not true. The Elves paper is an example of how it&#x27;s possible to argue for correctness from first principles whilst not presuming (indefinite) ability to re-execute. zk-SNARKS offer another means for doing this.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 08:00</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: In short, when GRANDPA finalises some state and you have a state-proof for some storage value against it, you can assume one of three things:
1. Elves/JAM/Polkadot has a design flaw nobody knows about.
2. More than 1/3 of validators are misbehaving.
3. It&#x27;s correct.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 08:01</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: It&#x27;s certainly categorically better than your characterisation of &quot;trust me bro, I&#x27;m infura&quot;. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

can I confirm that generative AI is ok (or not) for:
write documents
write tests
code review
help reading GP
doing research (e.g. how to write a recompiler)
write code that&#x27;s not covered by GP (e.g. RPC or CLI handling). In theory, those code should not be judged?</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 08:32</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Most should be fine, yes. The only slight concern would be for GP interpretation.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 08:33</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Again, it&#x27;s generally best to treat genAI as an indirect (and lossy) comms system.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 08:35</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: And comms concerning GP interpretation is generally best done in easily-discoverable forums visible to all to maximise the chances of clean-room impl and minimise the chances of sub-dialects (inadvertently) forming. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 08:37</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: It&#x27;s written in both English and formal logic in order to minimise the chance of linguistic issues for non-native speakers; I would not expect genAI to help much here and it may easily introduce translation artefacts. In any case, I fear genAI has less of a chance of knowing what I intend the GP to mean than you would. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 08:57</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4cbfa8'>xlchen</span>: is there any disassembler works with output of <code>jam-pvm-build</code>? I tried <code>polkatool disassemble</code> and it doesn&#x27;t work</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 08:58</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4cbfa8'>xlchen</span>: ok tried this and looking good so far <a href="https://pvm.fluffylabs.dev/?#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://pvm.fluffylabs.dev/?#/</a></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 09:01</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#da5c80'>jan</span>: Yes, that currently doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s just a matter of making a JAM blob -&gt; <code>.polkavm</code> blob converter, which is on my TODO list (but PRs are welcome; it should be very simple to do, just do the reverse of what the <code>jam-pvm-build</code> does, since it converts a <code>.polkavm</code> blob into a JAM blob)</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 09:15</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: After JAM light clients sync to the most recent finalized block through a GRANDPA proof, and receive a set of unfinalized blocks, what verification does the light client do when there is no GRANDPA proof for those unfinalized blocks, if anything at all?  It appears that JAM light clients only will be verifying GRANDPA proofs, and would trust the node that they receive their unfinalized block.  

What was 7.4.4 for?   <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 09:18</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: &gt; if anything at all?

None.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 09:19</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Light-clients are not intended to use unfinalized blocks.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 09:19</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: User interfaces might interpret them and display them with some sort of &quot;unconfirmed&quot; annotation if there&#x27;s any serious economic implication of them.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 09:19</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: Ok thank you for clarifying!  Indeed, I have had a Bitcoin mind virus =)</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 09:20</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: But light-clients generally have no means of knowing.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 09:20</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Even re-executing the block doesn&#x27;t help here - that&#x27;s the Bitcoin mind virus. You&#x27;d have to not only re-execute the block but also re-execute all the cores (at least those that have causal-implications on the service storage you care about, which given the ability for transfers to happen in a block means, theoretically, all of them which can send messages to your service). <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 09:22</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: To re-execute the cores, you&#x27;d need to fetch all of the DA data they require and this is obviously waaaay too much to be doing for a *light*-client. It&#x27;d take &gt; 6 seconds and then you may as well wait for GRANDPA. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 09:23</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: So yeah, there&#x27;s really no way around this, and that&#x27;s by design. We want to off-load correctness entirely into the game-theoretic (staked) machinery. Not have it done by clients on the edges, light or otherwise. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 09:24</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Only this way can we expect to be able to scale to the levels we need (and still not be centralised). <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 09:27</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: One thing that we can almost certainly do, though not necessarily pre-1.0, is have GRANDPA finalize not only the block but also its posterior state-root. This should be a pretty trivial addition and would mean light-clients are able to get proofs over storage one block earlier than otherwise. Alistair is also considering introducing some other lightweight consensus over blocks produced, but not necessarily correct (i.e. not yet having passed Elves). This wouldn&#x27;t help all that much for applications which have high economic implications but could help lower apparent UI latency for lesser applications especially if the finalised information included posterior state-root rather than just the header-hash. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 10:34</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: Would you expect JAM light nodes going through <a href="https://hackmd.io/@polkadot/jamprize#Light-node" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the light node path</a> to verify this new (not necessarily ELVES-correct) lightweight &quot;GRANDPA 2.0&quot; consensus at the bleeding edge?

The &quot;best vs finalized&quot; bits in jip-2 is causing us to want to fill in the GRANDPA related pieces of JAMNP (which has no vote/commit/... GRANDPA yet so we made some up earlier) and go from little syncs to warp syncs.  Having the GRANDPA 1.0 proof and 2.0 path would be terrific as we are happily auditing WPs now and can connect the dots to &quot;best block&quot; now. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 10:47</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: &gt; Would you expect JAM light nodes going through the light node path to verify this new (not necessarily ELVES-correct) lightweight &quot;GRANDPA 2.0&quot; consensus at the bleeding edge?

Possibly, assuming it is in the GP. But given it&#x27;s presently little more than an idea, it&#x27;s hard to say for sure if it would be in the GP by 1.0. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

Sure. Already there&#x27;s the <a href="https://research.web3.foundation/Polkadot/protocols/finality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GRANDPA paper</a> if you want to begin implementing the internals. I expect we&#x27;ll be able to introduce the protocol elements in the near future. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 10:49</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: It&#x27;s not yet amalgamated in to the GP but there&#x27;s not all that much to do on that front as GRANDPA is quite self-contained.</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 15:35</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c67452'>sourabhniyogi</span>: Ok!  So that we may plan our GRANDPA execution, which milestones [there are now 5+5(+1)+3=14] require { GRANDPA finality, GRANDPA proof verification, warp syncing }?

Can you speak to how we may instrument our implementations to measure and report on required performance at the Lisbon meetup for all 3 paths?</div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-14 15:36</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#cd8957'>gav</span>: Yeah I’ll try to state it as well as possible. But for a basic idea it’ll be in line with smoldot. </div>

- Can you confirm if it is JSON RPC over WebSocket? or something else?
- What encoding format is used? e.g. for Hash, is it hex string or JSON array of numbers?
- Only subscribe methods are defined but not unsubscribe?
- JSON RPC subscriptions requires another notification method as parameter, which is not included in the document</div>

Why do the accumulation test vectors not result in a change to the service storage state? I dont believe the storage attribute is included in these tests. Unless I am mistaken, based on the test service code there should be a host write call which if executed correctly should update the jam state for that service. If the service storage state isn&#x27;t tested here, isn&#x27;t the pvm invocation in these tests basically just a no-op then as far as passing the tests is concerned?

The others all seem useful as well, but I will let others speak to that. I imagine the log level can be specified to determine which of these we wish to see? </div>
<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-16 16:56</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#4068cd'>0xjunha</span>: I just tested with my implementation, and I could find the PVM code blobs of the accumulate test vectors include <code>ECALLI</code>. This is what we can guess from the test service code, which includes <code>jam_pvm_common::accumulate::set_storage</code>.

However, when I actually ran all accumulate test cases, and tracked trace of all executed opcodes, no single <code>ECALLI</code> was executed.
So my guess is that either <code>items</code> argument for the test service <code>accumulate</code> function is an empty vec, or <code>item.result</code> is not <code>Ok</code> and therefore no host function is executed even <code>accumulate</code> is invoked. (<a href="https://github.com/davxy/jam-test-vectors/blob/562f11d129d3a6ab35bfb91ad5973358ae0654fa/accumulate/test-service/src/main.rs/#L27C48-L27C74)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/davxy/jam-test-vectors/blob/562f11d129d3a6ab35bfb91ad5973358ae0654fa/accumulate/test-service/src/main.rs/#L27C48-L27C74)</a>

And I think this is just for simplicity, mainly focusing on Accumulate Queue/History STFs for now and I expect host function test cases might be added in the future.
My implementation is not complete yet, so there could be bugs in mine as well.\</div>

Hey JAM fam!

We&#x27;ve got some exciting news - Pala Labs is bringing JAM to **ETHLisbon** (May 9-11)! Since many JAM-ers will already be in Lisbon for the **JAM Experience**, we thought: why not introduce JAM to the Ethereum crowd too?

**Quick highlights**

- A keynote session dedicated to JAM on ( tentatively) May 10
- We&#x27;ll be having a cool JAM booth with some surprises …
- For builders, there&#x27;s also a Smart Contract hackathon on Kusama from 9 to 11 of May

**Exclusive invite for JAM Implementers!**

We&#x27;re planning an exclusive JAM Toaster visit just for JAM implementers on 6th May, 4 to 9 PM - free transportation, toaster visit, and poolside drinks &amp; canapés.

Limited spots available! (<a href="https://lu.ma/jamtoastervisit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sign up here</a> )

And of course, cool JAM merch with fantastic designs, like the one just on top of these lines, from the inkwell of xylodrone  - our talented inhouse designer.

Want to help at the booth or just hang out? Reach out to us!

See you in Lisbon! 🚀 <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

1. Get some sort of automation to periodically archive these two channels.
2. Host the archive in one or more obvious places (graypaper.com, jamcha.in, others?)
3. Request that others who want to have discourse away from these channels offer up the same thing and provide linking/hosting on these central spots for it.
4. Have some AI guy train an &quot;official&quot; AI model periodcally on the content of these channels as well as any lectures of mine, the Gray Paper &amp;c.

Regarding the prize, some time ago you mentioned, that as long as more than 50% of the codebase is in one language (in our case Scala), it would be ok to write small parts of it in another language. In our case, the PVM interpreter is implemented in Scala, but I&#x27;m looking at using Rust to implement the native execution parts for the PVM. Would that be fine, or would the Rust code fall under a different language category, irrespective of the size?</div>

<div class='msg'><time>2025-04-19 18:47</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#c9419d'>davxy</span>: The conformance testing tool will engage directly with your implementation (the target) in a more interactive fashion.

Naturally, passing all test vectors is a prerequisite, as the tool may expose your implementation to more complex or unforeseen scenarios. 

The overall process is relatively straightforward. Once the tool communicates the genesis state to the target, it will begin submitting procedurally generated blocks, which your implementation should attempt to import. It will then validate the resulting state root against the expected one. 

On failure, a test vector is produced (prior raw state kv + block + posterior diff with expected state).

The content of these blocks is pseudo-random and determined by a specific seed. To reproduce a particular run, the corresponding seed must be known.

The format of the state will align with the trace format adopted by the community, i.e. the whole state raw key-value (refer to the jam duna traces, also see <a href="https://github.com/davxy/jam-test-vectors/issues/40)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/davxy/jam-test-vectors/issues/40).</a> 

The communication between the conformance testing tool and the target implementation will occur over a simple pipe.

Additionally, the tool is capable of instructing the target to adopt a specific state, after which it can function as a pure fuzzer submitting millions of mutated versions of the same block (currently via libfuzzer, but we may experiment AFL as well)

Nothing is written in stone btw. The tool is currently a work in progress, and new ideas may emerge to refine it.  Further details can be discussed in Lisbon.

Some initial ideas were also drafted here:

For me it starts up and requests parameters, best block and service info (data and preimages), subscribes to statistics, and then basically stops updating the interface.

The interface updates are driven by updates from the statistics subscription, which should come once per block. Are you sure your node is sending these?</div>
<div class='msg reply'><time>2025-04-21 15:46</time>&ensp;<span class='u' style='color:#d470bf'>jaymansfield</span>: Yes it is sending statistics for each block. I noticed one thing not defined in JIP-2 and I&#x27;m wondering if it’s related to that.

Initial subscription:
{“jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:1,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;subscribeStatistics&quot;,&quot;params&quot;:\[false\]}

Response:
{“jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:1,&quot;result&quot;:&quot;7c0f6de3-75f6-4056-b24f-da377bb00a09&quot;}

Notification:
{“jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;subscribeStatistics&quot;,&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;subscription&quot;:\[&quot;7c0f6de3-75f6-4056-b24f-da377bb00a09&quot;\],&quot;result”:\[\[0,0,0,……\]\]}}

For the actual notifications/subscription events, what should the “method” be populated as? Right now for these I’m using the original method they subscribed too , for example: “subscribeStatistics” as there doesn’t seem to be a standard set in the JSON-RPC spec for this and seems it&#x27;s up to the implementation. I also tried just &quot;statistics&quot;. Some other RPC implementations use method: “subscription”, “notification”, “event”, etc but not sure what jamtop is expecting here. <span class="edited">(edited)</span></div>

<a href="https://hackmd.io/@sourabhniyogi/jip3-recommendation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://hackmd.io/@sourabhniyogi/jip3-recommendation</a>

Any changes going from JAMSNP to JAMNP, including codec encoding of the JAM representations, would be expected to follow in JIP3, making telemetry be a &quot;whatever you do in QUIC, you send to the telemetry server&quot;.

This enables each team with a working \[tiny\] testnet to simply share their entire logs with another team prior to working with them by simply providing their telemetry server endpoint (and their genesis state, which includes the validator set). This can be used as a prerequisite to enter into a larger network, including the &quot;full&quot; JAM Toaster.

What do you think of this?

- 0 \[block announcement for authoring\]

- 133/134/145 \[work package refinement/auditing\].

- 224/225 \[BLS Signature Generation\]

The telemetry server can usefully pipe this into Jaeger tracing (or similar) for visualization, but from attempting multihop XCM visualization, it probably helps to also have work package hash (133/134/145/137/138/139/140) and header hash (0/192/193/224/225) so the telemetry server doesn&#x27;t have to do any JAM-specific indexing -- then you can see a &quot;trace&quot; for any workpackage (refining and auditing) or a header hash (authoring, validating, finalizing).

Having data streams to attack bottlenecks that motivate <a href="https://github.com/ordian/RFCs/blob/main/text/0139-faster-erasure-coding.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RFC-139 - Faster Erasure Coding</a> and  <a href="https://github.com/thrumdev/nomt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super-I/O centric NOMT</a> would be cool.

With benchmark workpackages + services, a implementer leaderboard should be developed, focussing on KPIs central to meeting M3/M4 &quot;Kusama-performance&quot; and &quot;Polkadot-performance&quot; -- where we need guidance on what this means exactly so it falls out of the telemetry server dataset.

The benches are here: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkavm/tree/master/guest-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/paritytech/polkavm/tree/master/guest-programs</a>

The number are here: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkavm/blob/master/BENCHMARKS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/paritytech/polkavm/blob/master/BENCHMARKS.md</a>

I run these benchmarks across a lot of different VMs, so the tool has multiple backends: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkavm/tree/master/tools/benchtool/src/backend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/paritytech/polkavm/tree/master/tools/benchtool/src/backend</a>
